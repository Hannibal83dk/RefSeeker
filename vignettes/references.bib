abstract = {Housekeeping genes are involved in basic cell maintenance and, therefore, are expected to maintain constant expression levels in all cells and conditions. Identification of these genes facilitates exposure of the underlying cellular infrastructure and increases understanding of various structural genomic features. In addition, housekeeping genes are instrumental for calibration in many biotechnological applications and genomic studies. Advances in our ability to measure RNA expression have resulted in a gradual increase in the number of identified housekeeping genes. Here, we describe housekeeping gene detection in the era of massive parallel sequencing and RNA-seq. We emphasize the importance of expression at a constant level and provide a list of 3804 human genes that are expressed uniformly across a panel of tissues. Several exceptionally uniform genes are singled out for future experimental use, such as RT-PCR control genes. Finally, we discuss both ways in which current technology can meet some of past obstacles encountered, and several as yet unmet challenges. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns have been associated with a number of human diseases. Accurate quantitation of miRNA levels is important for their use as biomarkers and in determining their functions. Although the issue of proper miRNA detection was solved with the introduction of standard reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays, numerous issues with the selection of appropriate internal control genes remain. U6 (RNU6-1) snRNA, the most commonly used internal control gene in miRNA RT-qPCR assays, was shown to be unstable in clinical samples, particularly cancer tissues. Identification of the distribution of U6 in different tissues is the premise of more accurate quantification of miRNAs. However, the distribution of U6 in human carcinoma tissues and corresponding normal tissues is unknown. In the present study, U6 levels were significantly higher in human breast carcinoma tissues compared with the corresponding normal tissues by RT-qPCR. In the carcinoma or corresponding adjacent normal tissues, the expression levels of U6 in epithelial cells were higher than those in the mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of U6 in the carcinoma tissues of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts were higher than those in the adjacent normal tissues. These results suggest that the expression and distribution of U6 exhibits a high degree of variability among several types of human cells. Therefore, caution is required when selecting U6 as an internal control gene for evaluating expression profiles of miRNAs in patients with carcinoma, particularly carcinoma of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene-expression analysis is increasingly important in biological research, with real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) becoming the method of choice for high-throughput and accurate expression profiling of selected genes. Given the increased sensitivity, reproducibility and large dynamic range of this methodology, the requirements for a proper internal control gene for normalization have become increasingly stringent. Although housekeeping gene expression has been reported to vary considerably, no systematic survey has properly determined the errors related to the common practice of using only one control gene, nor presented an adequate way of working around this problem. RESULTS: We outline a robust and innovative strategy to identify the most stably expressed control genes in a given set of tissues, and to determine the minimum number of genes required to calculate a reliable normalization factor. We have evaluated ten housekeeping genes from different abundance and functional classes in various human tissues, and demonstrated that the conventional use of a single gene for normalization leads to relatively large errors in a significant proportion of samples tested. The geometric mean of multiple carefully selected housekeeping genes was validated as an accurate normalization factor by analyzing publicly available microarray data. CONCLUSIONS: The normalization strategy presented here is a prerequisite for accurate RT-PCR expression profiling, which, among other things, opens up the possibility of studying the biological relevance of small expression differences.},

abstract = {Recently, microRNAs have been detected in serum and plasma, and circulating microRNA (miRNA) profiles have now been associated with many diseases such as cancers and heart disease, as well as altered physiological states. Because of their stability and disease resistance, circulation miRNAs appear to be an ideal material for biomarkers of diseases and physiological states in blood. However, the lack of a suitable internal reference gene (internal reference miRNA) has hampered research and application of circulating miRNAs. Currently, U6 and miR-16 are the most common endogenous controls in the research of miRNAs in tissues and cells. We performed microarray-based serum miRNA profiling on the serum of 20 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and 20 controls to detect the expressions of U6 and miRNAs. Profiling was followed by real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) in 80 patients (20 each with gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer) and 30 non-cancerous controls. qPCR was also performed to detect miRNAs in serum with repeated freezing and thawing. The results of microarray showed that with the exception of U6, Ct values of miR-16, miR-24, miR-142-3p, miR-19b and miR-192 in serum samples of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were greater than control samples. The results of 110 cases showed large fluctuations in U6 expression. The difference between the greatest and the least levels of expression was 3.29 for delta Ct values, and 1.23 for miR-16. The expressions of U6, miR-16 and miR-24 in serum subjected to different freeze-thaw cycles showed that U6 expression gradually decreased after 1, 2, and 4 cycles of freezing and thawing, while the expression of miR-16 and miR-24 remained relatively stable. Collectively, our results suggested that U6 is unsuitable as an internal reference gene in the research of circulating miRNAs.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to determine the intratumoral distribution of miRNA expression profiles in luminal breast cancer (BC). The study included 33 certain BC cases of the luminal A or luminal B (Her2-) subtypes. The relative expression levels of miRNA-20a;-21;-125b;-126;-200b;-181a;-205;-221;-222;-451a;-99a;-145;-200a;-214;-30a;-191; and small nuclear RNAs U6, U54, and U58 were measured by RT-qPCR in four intratumor areas in each of 33 luminal BC specimens and in surrounding normal mammary gland tissues. Comparative analysis of miRNA expression levels between normal mammary gland tissue and different intratumor areas revealed that only four miRNAs (miRNA-21,-200b,-200a,-191) appear as consistently differentiating markers. A comparative analysis of miRNA expression levels between normal mammary gland tissue and the tumor border revealed statistically significant differences for ten miRNAs; 10 miRNAs show differential expression between normal mammary gland tissue and central tumor specimens; 9 miRNAs show differential expression between normal mammary gland tissue and tumor periphery 1; 13 miRNAs show differential expression between normal mammary gland tissue and tumor periphery 2. After comparing the tumor periphery 1 and tumor center, we found statistically significant differences in expression between five miRNAs and after comparing the tumor periphery 2 and tumor center, differences were observed for 12 miRNAs. MiRNA expression levels are subject to considerable variation, depending on the intratumor area. This may explain the inconsistency in miRNA expression estimates in BC coming from different laboratories.},

abstract = {The choice of reference genes that are stably expressed amongst treatment groups is a crucial step in real-time quantitative PCR gene expression studies. Recent guidelines have specified that a minimum of two validated reference genes should be used for normalisation. However, a quantitative review of the literature showed that the average number of reference genes used across all studies was 1.2. Thus, the vast majority of studies continue to use a single gene, with $\beta$-actin (ACTB) and/or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) being commonly selected in studies of vertebrate gene expression. Few studies (15%) tested a panel of potential reference genes for stability of expression before using them to normalise data. Amongst studies specifically testing reference gene stability, few found ACTB or GAPDH to be optimal, whereby these genes were significantly less likely to be chosen when larger panels of potential reference genes were screened. Fewer reference genes were tested for stability in non-model organisms, presumably owing to a dearth of available primers in less well characterised species. Furthermore, the experimental conditions under which real-time quantitative PCR analyses were conducted had a large influence on the choice of reference genes, whereby different studies of rat brain tissue showed different reference genes to be the most stable. These results highlight the importance of validating the choice of normalising reference genes before conducting gene expression studies.},

Moreover, we reported the first complete study of Pgk1 expression throughout the development and the aging of mouse brain. Although no tested gene showed to be the optimal reference for all mouse brain regions, in general, the new housekeeping genes were highly stable in most of the analyzed regions.

This work aimed to compare different normalization approaches for RT-qPCR data analyses, in order to identify the most reliable and reproducible method to analyze circulating miRNA expression profiles in sedentary and highly-trained subjects. As the physically active status is known to affect miRNA expression, they could be effective biomarkers of the homeostatic response. Following RNA extraction from plasma, a panel of 179 miRNAs was assayed by RT-qPCR and quantified by applying different normalization strategies based on endogenous miRNAs and exogenous oligonucleotides. hsa-miR-320d was found as the most appropriate reference miRNA in reducing the technical variability among the experimental replicates and, hence, in highlighting the inter-cohorts differences. Our data showed an association between the physically active status and specific skeletal muscle- and bone-associated circulating miRNAs profiles, revealing that established epigenetic modifications affect the baseline physiological status of these tissues. Since different normalization strategies led to different outputs, in order to avoid misleading interpretation of data, we remark the importance of the accurate choice of the most reliable normalization method in every experimental setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epithelial ovarian cancer continues to be a deleterious threat to  women as it is asymptomatic and is typically detected in advanced stages. Cogent non-invasive biomarkers are therefore needed which are effective in apprehending the disease in early stages. Recently, miRNA deregulation has shown a promising magnitude in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis. miRNA-145(miR- 145) is beginning to be understood for its possible role in cancer development and progression. In this study, we identified the clinicopathological hallmarks altered owing to the downexpression of serum miR-145 in EOC. METHODS: 70 serum samples from histopathologically confirmed EOC patients and 70 controls were collected. Total RNA from serum was isolated by Trizol method, polyadenylated and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Expression level of miR-145 was detected by miRNA qRT-PCR using RNU6B snRNA as reference. RESULTS: The alliance of miR-145 profiling amongst patients and controls established itself to be conspicuous with a significant p-value (p<0.0001). A positive conglomeration (p=0.04) of miR-145 profiling was manifested with histopathological grade. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve highlights the diagnostic potential and makes it imminent with a robust Area Under the curve (AUC). A positive correlation with the ROC curve was also noted for histological grade, FIGO stage, distant metastasis, lymph node status and survival. CONCLUSION: Our results propose that miR-145 down-regulation might be a possible touchstone for disease progression and be identified as a diagnostic marker and predict disease outcome in EOC patients.},

abstract = {Objectives microRNAs comprise a family of small, non-coding RNAs, which regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Multiple studies implicated important roles of microRNAs in various malignancies including endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC). qPCR is widely used in the studies investigating microRNA expression. Relative quantification of microRNA expression requires proper normalization methods and endogenous controls are widely used for this purpose. The aim of this study was experimental identification of stable endogenous controls for normalization of microRNA qPCR expression studies in EEC. Methods Expression of twelve candidate endogenous controls (miR-16, miR-26b, miR-92a, RNU44, RNU48, U75, U54, U6, U49, RNU6B, RNU38B, U18A) was investigated in tissue samples obtained from 45 patients (30 EEC, 15 normal endometrium) using qPCR. Stability of candidate endogenous controls was evaluated using NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper and equivalency test. The results were then validated using larger group of samples. Results RNU48, U75 and RNU44 were identified as stably and equivalently expressed between malignant and normal tissues. Both NormFinder and geNorm indicated that those three snRNAs were optimal for qPCR data normalization in EEC tissues. Conclusions In conclusion, we suggest that average expression of those snoRNAs could be used as a reliable endogenous control in microRNA qPCR studies in endometrioid endometrial cancer. In addition to identifying suitable endogenous controls in EEC, our study presents an appropriate strategy for validation of candidate reference genes for any microRNA qPCR study. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), reference genes are utilized as endogenous controls for relative quantification of target genes in gene profiling studies. The suitability of housekeeping genes for that purpose in prostate cancer tissue has not been sufficiently investigated so far. The objective of this study was to select from a panel of 16 potential candidate reference genes the most stable genes for gene normalization. Expression of mRNA encoding ACTB, ALAS1, ALB, B2M, G6PD, GAPD, HMBS, HPRT1, K-ALPHA-1, POLR2A, PPIA, RPL13A, SDHA, TBP, UBC, and YWHAZ was examined in matched, microdissected malignant and nonmalignant tissue specimens obtained from 17 nontreated prostate carcinomas after radical prostatectomy by real-time RT-PCR. The genes studied displayed a wide expression range with cycle threshold values between 16 and 37. The expression was not different between samples from pT2 and pT3 tumors or between samples with Gleason scores <7 and ≥7 (P>0.05). ACTB, RPL13A, and HMBS showed significant differences (P<0.02 at least) in expressions between malignant and nonmalignant pairs. All other genes did not differ between the matched pairs, and the software programs geNorm and NormFinder were used to ascertain the most suitable reference genes from these candidates. HPRT1, ALAS1, and K-ALPHA-1 were calculated by both programs to be the most stable genes covering a broad range of expression. The expression of the target gene RECK normalized with HRPT1 alone and with the normalization factors generated by the combination of these three reference genes as well as with the unstable genes ACTB or RPL13A is given. That example shows the significance of using suitable reference genes to avoid erroneous normalizations in gene profiling studies for prostate cancer. The use of HPRT1 alone as a reference gene shown in our study was sufficient, but the normalization factors generated from two (HRPT1, ALAS1) or all three genes (HRPT1, ALAS1, K-ALPHA-1) should be considered for an improved reliability of normalization in gene profiling studies of prostate cancer. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {Introduction Plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising biomarkers for many forms of cancer in humans; however, a fundamental concern is the lack of standardization in current data acquisition and reporting. Part of this problem lies in the use of numerous, different housekeeping genes (HKG) for the acquisition of real-time polymerase chain reaction data. This existing practice of using different HKGs generally is accepted, but reproducibility of data for comparison and validation between different laboratories calls for improvement. The need for data reproducibility standardization is crucial. An ideal plasma HKG (1) should be expressed in all samples, (2) have medium-to-high levels of expression, and (3) have consistently measurable levels of expression. Methods Total RNA was extracted from 200-$\mu$L plasma samples via a modified miRNeasy (QIAGEN) extraction technique with yeast carrier. Total RNA purity was assessed with a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). The cycle threshold (Ct) was fixed at 0.03 for all samples. We investigated 10 potential HKGs based both on reports in the literature and our previous data. The potential HKGs were Let-7a, Let-7d, Let-7g, miR-16, RNU6, RNU48, miR-191, miR-223, miR-484, and miR-520d-5p. Once all samples were run for each potential HKG, the mean Ct and SD was calculated for all sample groups, allowing for comparison among HKGs. Results We screened 380 miRNAs by using microfluidic array technology (Applied Biosystems) in a discovery cohort of 20 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, 10 patients each with breast cancer (BC), lung cancer (LC), pancreatic cancer (PC), 11 patients with colorectal adenoma, and 12 controls. The mean Ct and SD was calculated for RNU6, miR-520d-5p, miR-16, miR-191, miR-223, and miR-484, which were expressed in all samples. Let-7a, Let-7d, Let-7g, and RNU48 were only expressed in 26%, 7%, 10%, and 8% of samples, respectively, and therefore were deemed to be insufficiently reliable HKGs. Only miRNAs with >50% expression were included in this statistical analysis. U6 and miR-520d-5p had the most consistent Ct as well as the least SD. The use of both RNU6 and 520d-5p as HKGs provided reliable results. Conclusion Among HKGs that were expressed in all samples, we suggest that RNU6 and miR-520d-5p were the best candidates for HKGs for studies of plasma miRNA because of the consistent and high Ct in all samples and a very narrow, reproducible SD.},

abstract = {Objectives: To identify an appropriate reference gene for the analysis of circulating micro-ribonucleic acid in patients with urological malignancies. Methods: Serum from patients with prostate cancer (n=24), bladder cancer (n=24), renal cell carcinoma (n=24) and control subjects (n=48) was spiked with cel-miR-39, and then ribonucleic acid was isolated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of candidate reference genes (RNU1-4, RNU6-2, SNORD43, SNORD44, SNORD48, SNORA74A, miR-let-7a-1, miR-106a). Reference gene stability was determined using the NormFinder, geNorm and comparative delta-Ct algorithm. The effect of normalization was tested with miR-21 as the target gene, as this was previously suggested to be upregulated in cancer patients' serum. Results: Recovery of cel-miR-39 (mean 11.6%, range 1-56%) was similar in control subjects and cancer patients. SNORD44 and SNORD74A levels were around the detection limit of the assay and were thus omitted. All remaining candidates showed satisfying stability; SNORD43 was the most stable reference gene using all three algorithms. A combination of two genes (SNORD43, RNU1-4) increases the stability somewhat. The level of miR-21 was similar in cancer patients and healthy controls, irrespective of the normalization strategy. Conclusions: SNORD43 is a suitable reference gene for the analysis of circulating micro-ribonucleic acid in patients with urological malignancies. Our study questions the suitability of miR-21 as a biomarker for uro-oncological patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Japanese Urological Association.},

abstract = {Failure to detect early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a major contributing factor to its low survival rate. Increasing evidence suggests that different subtypes of EOC may behave as distinct diseases due to their different cells of origins, histology and treatment responses. Therefore, the identification of EOC subtype-specific biomarkers that can early detect the disease should be clinically beneficial. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by different types of cells and carry biological molecules, which play important roles in cell-cell communication and regulation of various biological processes. Multiple studies have proposed that exosomal miRNAs present in the circulation are good biomarkers for non-invasive early detection of cancer. In this review, the potential use of exosomal miRNAs as early detection biomarkers for EOCs and their accuracy are discussed. We also review the differential expression of circulating exosomal miRNAs and cell-free miRNAs between different biofluid sources, i.e., plasma and serum, and touch on the issue of endogenous reference miRNA selection. Additionally, the current clinical trials using miRNAs for detecting EOCs are summarized. In conclusion, circulating exosomal miRNAs as the non-invasive biomarkers have a high potential for early detection of EOC and its subtypes, and are likely to be clinically important in the future.},

Large (LEVs) and small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) are extracellular vesicles (EVs) of different sizes and biological functions transported in blood and they may be valid biomarkers for NDs. The aim of our study was to investigate common and different miRNA signatures in plasma derived LEVs and SEVs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Fronto‐Temporal Dementia (FTD) patients. LEVs and SEVs were isolated from plasma of patients and healthy volunteers (CTR) by filtration and differential centrifugation and RNA was extracted. Small RNAs libraries were carried out by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). MiRNAs discriminate all NDs diseases from CTRs and they can provide a signature for each NDs. Common enriched pathways for SEVs were instead linked to ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and Toll‐like receptor signaling pathways and for LEVs to neurotrophin signaling and Glycosphingolipid biosynthesis pathway. LEVs and SEVs are involved in different pathways and this might give a specificity to their role in the spreading of the disease. The study of common and different miRNAs transported by LEVs and SEVs can be of great interest for biomarker discovery and for pathogenesis studies in neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Background: DNA microarray technology has permitted the analysis of global gene expression profiles for several diseases, including cancer. However, standard hybridisation and detection protocols require micrograms of mRNA for microarray analysis, limiting broader application of this technology to small excisional biopsies, needle biopsies, and/or microdissected tissue samples. Therefore, linear amplification protocols to increase the amount of RNA have been developed. The correlation between the results of microarray experiments derived from non-amplified RNA and amplified samples needs to be evaluated in detail. Methods: Total RNA was amplified and replicate hybridisation experiments were performed with linearly amplified (aRNA) and non-amplified mRNA from tonsillar B cells and the SUDHL-6 cell line using cDNA microarrays containing approximately 4500 genes. The results of microarray differential expression using either source of RNA (mRNA or aRNA) were also compared with those found using real time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Results: Microarray experiments using aRNA generated reproducible data displaying only small differences to data obtained from non-amplified mRNA. The quality of the starting total RNA template and the concentration of the promoter primer used to synthesise cDNA were crucial components of the linear amplification reaction. Approximately 80% of selected upregulated and downregulated genes identified by microarray analysis using linearly amplified RNA were confirmed by QRT-PCR using non-amplified mRNA as the starting template. Conclusions: Linear RNA amplification methods can be used to generate high fidelity microarray expression data of comparable qualify to data generated by microarray methods that use non-amplified mRNA samples.},

abstract = {Angiogenesis is a prerequisite for progression of cancers. The number of genes linked to angiogenesis suggests the existence of complex gene-networks, which remain to be elucidated. To identify angiogenesis genes deregulated in carcinomas, we performed a meta-profiling analysis of published gene expression microarray studies. Own microarray and quantitative RT-PCR data were obtained from a colorectal carcinoma cohort. Applying highly stringent inclusion criteria, 15 cancer array studies were suitable for our analysis. These studies provided 789 tumor specimens and 190 samples of healthy tissues yielding a total of approx. 1,000,000 gene expression measurements. Meta-analysis on the expression of 480 angiogenesis-related genes in 10 cancer types identified a characteristic, entity-independent "global" cancer expression signature of 25 angiogenesis-related genes showing high frequency down-regulation when compared to corresponding healthy tissues. Furthermore, we characterized 25 genes displaying frequent up-regulation, yet less often than the 25 down-regulated genes. Comparative inter-study cross-validation revealed that both signatures discriminate cancers from healthy tissues with high accuracy in independent test sets. Moreover, own microarray data of colorectal carcinomas confirmed the specific and sensitive discriminating potential of both signatures. These results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR for eight genes displaying the highest differences in the microarray analysis. Our study for the first time defines global gene expression signatures linked to angiogenesis in carcinomas. Our findings suggest that gene down-regulation may represent a central aspect of tumor angiogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

At the molecular level, significant progress has been made in our understanding of ovarian cancer development and progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single-stranded, highly conserved non-coding RNA molecules (19–25 nucleotides) that negatively regulate target genes post-transcriptionally. Over the last two decades, mounting evidence has demonstrated the aberrant expression of miRNAs in different human malignancies, including ovarian carcinomas. Deregulated miRNAs can have profound impacts on various cancer hallmarks by repressing tumor suppressor genes. This review will discuss up-to-date knowledge of how the aberrant expression of miRNAs and their targeted genes drives ovarian cancer initiation, proliferation, survival, and resistance to chemotherapies. Understanding the mechanisms by which these miRNAs affect these hallmarks should allow the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat these lethal malignancies.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related dementia. Among its major challenges is identifying molecular signatures characteristic for the early AD stage in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI-AD), which could serve for deciphering the AD pathomechanism and also as non-invasive, easy-to-access biomarkers. Using qRT-PCR we compared the microRNA (miRNA) profiles in blood plasma of 15 MCI-AD patients, whose diagnoses were confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, with 20 AD patients and 15 non-demented, age-matched individuals (CTR). To minimize methodological variability, we adhered to standardization of blood and CSF assays recommended by the international Joint Programming for Neurodegenerative Diseases (JPND) BIOMARKAPD consortium, and we employed commercially available Exiqon qRT-PCR-assays. In the first screening, we assessed 179 miRNAs of plasma. We confirmed 23 miRNAs reported earlier as AD biomarker candidates in blood and found 26 novel differential miRNAs between AD and control subjects. For representative 15 differential miRNAs, the TargetScan, MirTarBase and KEGG database analysis indicated putative protein targets among such AD hallmarks as MAPT (Tau), proteins involved in amyloidogenic proteolysis, and in apoptosis. These 15 miRNAs were verified in separate, subsequent subject groups. Finally, 6 miRNAs (3 not yet reported in AD context and 3 reported in AD blood) were selected as the most promising biomarker candidates differentiating early AD from controls with the highest fold changes (from 1.32 to 14.72), consistent significance, specificities from 0.78 to 1 and sensitivities from 0.75 to 1.

Nowadays, there is an urgent need to identify reliable biomarkers that could be obtained with non-invasive methods to improve AD diagnosis at early stages. Here, we have examined plasma levels of a group of miRNAs related to synaptic proteins in a cohort composed of cognitive healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects. Methods: Plasma and brain levels of miRNAs were analysed in two different cohorts including 38 HC, 26 MCI, 56 AD dementia patients and 27 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. D'Agostino and Pearson and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to evaluate data normality. miRNA levels between groups were compared using a two-sided nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and sensitivity and specificity was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: Significant upregulation of miR-92a-3p, miR-181c-5p and miR-210-3p was found in the plasma of both MCI and AD subjects. MCI patients that progress to AD showed higher plasma levels of these miRNAs. By contrast, no changes in miR-92a-3p, miR-181c-5p or miR-210-3p levels were observed in plasma obtained from a cohort of FTD. Conclusion: Our study shows that plasma miR-92a-3p, miR-181c-5p and miR-210-3p constitute a specific molecular signature potentially useful as a potential biomarker for AD.},

Several studies that explored the role of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrated their usefulness in clinical identification. Nevertheless, miRNAs that may act as endogenous controls (ECs) have not yet been established. The identification of ECs would contribute to the standardization of these biomarkers in AD. The objective of the study was to identify miRNAs that can be used as ECs in AD. Methods: We evaluated 145 patients divided into two different cohorts. One was a discovery cohort of 19 women diagnosed with mild to moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 20) and with confirmed pathologic levels of A$\beta$42 in CSF. The stability assessment cohort consisted of 126 individuals: 24 subjects without AD or any kind of dementia and negative for all core CSF biomarkers of AD, 25 subjects with MCI and negative for CSF biomarkers (MCI −), 22 subjects with MCI and positive for CSF biomarkers (MCI +), and 55 subjects with AD and positive for CSF biomarkers. In the discovery cohort, a profile of 384 miRNAs was determined in the plasma by TaqMan low-density array. The best EC candidates were identified by mean-centering and concordance correlation restricted normalization methods. The stability of the EC candidates was assessed using the GeNorm, BestKeeper, and NormFinder algorithms. Results: Nine miRNAs (hsa-miR-324-5p, hsa-miR-22-5p, hsa-miR-103a-2-5p, hsa-miR-362-5p, hsa-miR-425-3p, hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-let-7i-3p, hsa-miR-532-5p, and hsa-miR-1301-3p) were identified as EC candidates in the discovery cohort. The validation results indicated that hsa-miR-103a-2-5p was the best EC, followed by hsa-miR-22-5p, hsa-miR-1301-3p, and hsa-miR-425-3p, which had similar stability values in all three algorithms. Conclusions: We identified a profile of four miRNAs as potential plasma ECs to be used for normalization of miRNA expression data in studies of subjects with cognitive impairment.},

abstract = {Background: Microarray technology has become very popular for globally evaluating gene expression in biological samples. However, non-linear variation associated with the technology can make data interpretation unreliable. Therefore, methods to correct this kind of technical variation are critical. Here we consider a method to reduce this type of variation applied after three common procedures for processing microarray data: MAS 5.0, RMA, and dChip{\textregistered}. Results: We commonly observe intensity-dependent technical variation between samples in a single microarray experiment. This is most common when MAS 5.0 is used to process probe level data, but we also see this type of technical variation with RMA and dChip{\textregistered} processed data. Datasets with unbalanced numbers of up and down regulated genes seem to be particularly susceptible to this type of intensity-dependent technical variation. Unbalanced gene regulation is common when studying cancer samples or genetically manipulated animal models and preservation of this biologically relevant information, while removing technical variation has not been well addressed in the literature. We propose a method based on using rank-invariant, endogenous transcripts as reference points for normalization (GRSN). While the use of rank-invariant transcripts has been described previously, we have added to this concept by the creation of a global rank-invariant set of transcripts used to generate a robust average reference that is used to normalize all samples within a dataset. The global rank-invariant set is selected in an iterative manner so as to preserve unbalanced gene expression. Moreover, our method works well as an overlay that can be applied to data already processed with other probe set summary methods. We demonstrate that this additional normalization step at the "probe set level" effectively corrects a specific type of technical variation that often distorts samples in datasets. Conclusion: We have developed a simple post-processing tool to help detect and correct non-linear technical variation in microarray data and demonstrate how it can reduce technical variation and improve the results of downstream statistical gene selection and pathway identification methods. {\textcopyright} 2008 Pelz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The anthrax pathogen Bacillus anthracis poses a significant threat to human health. Identification of B. anthracis is challenging because of the bacterium's close genetic relationship to other Bacillus cereus group species. Thus, molecular detection is founded on species-specific PCR targeting single-copy genes. Here, we validated a previously recognized multi-copy target, a species-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) present in 2–5 copies in every B. anthracis genome analyzed. For this, a hydrolysis probe-based real-time PCR assay was developed and rigorously tested. The assay was specific as only B. anthracis DNA yielded positive results, was linear over 9 log10 units, and was sensitive with a limit of detection (LoD) of 2.9 copies/reaction. Though not exhibiting a lower LoD than established single-copy PCR targets (dhp61 or PL3), the higher copy number of the B. anthracis–specific 16S rRNA gene alleles afforded ≤2 unit lower threshold (Ct) values. To push the detection limit even further, the assay was adapted for reverse transcription PCR on 16S rRNA transcripts. This RT-PCR assay was also linear over 9 log10 units and was sensitive with an LoD of 6.3 copies/reaction. In a dilution series of experiments, the 16S RT-PCR assay achieved a thousand-fold higher sensitivity than the DNA-targeting assays. For molecular diagnostics, we recommend a real-time RT-PCR assay variant in which both DNA and RNA serve as templates (thus, no requirement for DNase treatment).

abstract = {Circulating microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers are implicated in the diagnosis, monitoring and prediction of various disease processes. Before embarking upon biomarker discovery, miRNA extraction techniques must first be optimised in the biofluid and population under study. Using plasma from a healthy pregnant woman, it was attempted to optimise and compare the performance of two commercially available miRNA extrac- tion kits; Qiagen (miRNeasy Serum/Plasma) and Promega (Maxwell{\textregistered} RSC miRNA from Tissue or Plasma or Serum). Sample miRNA content (concentration and percentage) was assessed using Agilent Bioanalyzer Small RNA chips and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using four consti- tutively expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-222-3p, hsa-let-7i-3p, hsa-miR-148-3p and hsa-miR-30e-5p). Quality control spike-ins monitored RNA extraction (UniSp2, 4 and 5) and cDNA synthesis (UniSp6, cel-miR-39-3p) efficiency. Optimisation approaches included: i) Starting volume of plasma; the addition of ii) Proteinase K; iii) a RNA bacteriophage carrier (MS2); and iv) a glycogen carrier. The two kits exhibited equivalence in terms of miRNA recovery based on Bioanalyzer and RT-qPCR $\Delta$$\Delta$Cq results. Optimisation attempts for both kits failed to improve upon miRNA content compared with standard meth- odology. Comparing the standard methodology, the Qiagen kit was more consistent (smaller variance of $\Delta$Cq values) compared with the Promega kit. The standard methodology of either kit would be suitable for the investigation of miRNA biomarkers in a healthy pregnant population.},

In recent years, extraordinary progress has been made in terms of identifying the origin and exact functions of miRNA, focusing on their potential use in both the research and the clinical field. This review aims at improving the current understanding of these molecules and their applicability in the medical field. A thorough analysis of the literature consulting resources available in online databases such as NCBI, PubMed, Medline, ScienceDirect, and UpToDate was performed. There is promising evidence that in spite of the lack of standardized protocols regarding the use of miRNAs in current clinical practice, they constitute a reliable tool for future use. These molecules meet most of the required criteria for being an ideal biomarker, such as accessibility, high specificity, and sensitivity. Despite present limitations, miRNAs as biomarkers for various conditions remain an impressive research field. As current techniques evolve, we anticipate that miRNAs will become a routine approach in the development of personalized patient profiles, thus permitting more specific therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small cellular RNAs (typically 21-23. nt) that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Current estimates indicate that more than one third of the cellular transcriptome is regulated by miRNAs, although they are relatively few in number (less than 2000 human miRNAs).The high relative stability of miRNA in common clinical tissues and biofluids (e.g. plasma, serum, urine, saliva, etc.) and the ability of miRNA expression profiles to accurately classify discrete tissue types and disease states have positioned miRNA quantification as a promising new tool for a wide range of diagnostic applications. Furthermore miRNAs have been shown to be rapidly released from tissues into the circulation with the development of pathology. To facilitate discovery and clinical development of miRNA-based biomarkers, we developed a genome-wide Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA™)-based miRNA qPCR platform with unparalleled sensitivity and robustness. The platform allows high-throughput profiling of miRNAs from important clinical sources without the need for pre-amplification. Using this system, we have profiled thousands of biofluid samples including blood derived plasma and serum. An extensive quality control (QC) system has been implemented in order to secure technical excellence and reveal any unwanted bias coming from pre-analytical or analytical variables. We present our approaches to sample and RNA QC as well as data QC and normalization. Specifically we have developed normal reference ranges for circulating miRNAs in serum and plasma as well as a hemolysis indicator based on microRNA expression. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the last years, circulating miRNAs have emerged as a new class of promising cancer biomarkers. Independent studies have shown the feasibility of using these small RNAs as tools for the diagnosis and prognosis of different types of malignancies as well as for predicting and possibly monitoring treatment response. However, despite an initial enthusiasm for their possible clinical application, widespread inconsistencies have been observed among the studies, and miRNA-based tools still represent the object of research within clinical diagnostic or treatment protocols. The poor overlap of results could be explained, at least in part, by preanalytical and analytical variables and donor-related factors that could generate artefacts, impairing an accurate quantification of circulating miRNAs. In fact, critical issues are represented by nonuniform sample choice, handling, and processing, as well as by blood cell contamination in sample preparation and lack of consensus for data normalization. In this review, we address the potential technical biases and individual-related parameters that can influence circulating miRNA studies' outcome. The exciting potential of circulating miRNAs as cancer biomarkers could confer an important advance in the disease management, but their clinical significance might not be proven without a global consensus of procedures and standardized protocols for their accurate detection.},

abstract = {Since numerous miRNAs have been shown to be present in circulation, these so-called circulating miRNAs have emerged as potential biomarkers for disease. However, results of qPCR studies on circulating miRNA biomarkers vary greatly and many experiments cannot be reproduced. Missing data in qPCR experiments often occur due to off-target amplification, nonanalyzable qPCR curves and discordance between replicates. The low concentration of most miRNAs leads to most, but not all missing data. Therefore, failure to distinguish between missing data due to a low concentration and missing data due to randomly occurring technical errors partly explains the variation within and between otherwise similar studies. Based on qPCR kinetics, an analysis pipeline was developed to distinguish missing data due to technical errors from missing data due to a low concentration of the miRNA-equivalent cDNA in the PCR reaction. Furthermore, this pipeline incorporates a method to statistically decide whether concentrations from replicates are sufficiently concordant, which improves stability of results and avoids unnecessary data loss. By going through the pipeline's steps, the result of each measurement is categorized as "valid, invalid, or undetectable." Together with a set of imputation rules, the pipeline leads to more robust and reproducible data as was confirmed experimentally. Using two validation approaches, in two cohorts totaling 2214 heart failure patients, we showed that this pipeline increases both the accuracy and precision of qPCR measurements. In conclusion, this statistical data handling pipeline improves the performance of qPCR studies on low-expressed targets such as circulating miRNAs.},

They can also function as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Recent studies have revealed that miRNA-451 (miR-451) is involved in the regulation of various human physiological and pathological processes. Furthermore, it has been shown that miR-451 not only directly affects the biological functions of tumor cells but also indirectly affects tumor cell invasion and metastasis upon secretion into the tumor microenvironment via exosomes. Thus, miR-451 also influences the progression of tumorigenesis and drug resistance. This review summarizes the expression of miR-451 in various cancer types and the relationship between miR-451 and the diagnosis, treatment, and drug resistance of solid tumors. In addition, we address possible mechanisms of action of miR-451 and its potential application as a biomarker in the diagnosis and treatment of human cancers.},

abstract = {The presence of cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) has been detected in a range of body fluids. The miRNA content of plasma/serum in particular has been proposed as a potential source of novel biomarkers for a number of diseases. Nevertheless, the quantification of miRNAs from plasma or serum is made difficult due to inefficient isolation and lack of consensus regarding the optimal reference miRNA. The effect of haemolysis on the quantification and normalisation of miRNAs in plasma has not been investigated in great detail. We found that levels of miR-16, a commonly used reference gene, showed little variation when measured in plasma samples from healthy volunteers or patients with malignant mesothelioma or coronary artery disease. Including samples with evidence of haemolysis led to variation in miR-16 levels and consequently decreased its ability to serve as a reference. The levels of miR-16 and miR-451, both present in significant levels in red blood cells, were proportional to the degree of haemolysis. Measurements of the level of these miRNAs in whole blood, plasma, red blood cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that the miRNA content of red blood cells represents the major source of variation in miR-16 and miR-451 levels measured in plasma. Adding lysed red blood cells to non-haemolysed plasma allowed a cut-off level of free haemoglobin to be determined, below which miR-16 and miR-451 levels displayed little variation between individuals. In conclusion, increases in plasma miR-16 and miR-451 are caused by haemolysis. In the absence of haemolysis the levels of both miR-16 and miR-451 are sufficiently constant to serve as normalisers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kirschner et al.},

MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) levels have recently emerged as novel biomarkers for different diseases. However, the conventional RNU6B (U6), used as the reference for intracellular miRNA, may not be appropriate for the normalization of circulating miRNAs. Methods: We measured the levels of U6, spiked-in RNA, and miR-21 in the BMF of 13 healthy controls and 37 patients with hematological disorders to investigate the reliability of either U6 or spike-in RNA as an endogenous reference and also to study the correlation between miR-21, hematological disorders and mortality. Results: Notably, the levels of U6 demonstrated a high variability in BMF of healthy controls and patients. In contrast, the levels of spiked-in RNA displayed a significantly higher stability in both cohorts. Compared with controls, the levels of miR-21 were significantly upregulated in BMF of patients with leukemia but not lymphoma. Also, using 21 as the cut-off value of miR-21, it differentiated the mortality of patients with hematologic disorders. Conclusions: Collectively, using spiked-in RNA as a reference the upregulated miR-21 levels in BMF could be an indicator of the diagnosis of leukemia and a predictor of mortality.},

abstract = {Real-time reverse transcription PCR (qPCR) normalized to an internal reference gene (RG), is a frequently used method for quantifying gene expression changes in neuroscience. Although RG expression is assumed to be constant independent of physiological or experimental conditions, several studies have shown that commonly used RGs are not expressed stably. The use of unstable RGs has a profound effect on the conclusions drawn from studies on gene expression, and almost universally results in spurious estimation of target gene expression. Approaches aimed at selecting and validating RGs often make use of different statistical methods, which may lead to conflicting results. Based on published RG validation studies involving hypoxia the present study evaluates the expression of 5 candidate RGs (Actb, Pgk1, Sdha, Gapdh, Rnu6b) as a function of hypoxia exposure and hypothermic treatment in the neonatal rat cerebral cortex–in order to identify RGs that are stably expressed under these experimental conditions–using several statistical approaches that have been proposed to validate RGs. In doing so, we first analyzed RG ranking stability proposed by several widely used statistical methods and related tools, i.e. the Coefficient of Variation (CV) analysis, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the $\Delta$Ct method. Using the Geometric mean rank, Pgk1 was identified as the most stable gene. Subsequently, we compared RG expression patterns between the various experimental groups. We found that these statistical methods, next to producing different rankings per se, all ranked RGs displaying significant differences in expression levels between groups as the most stable RG. As a consequence, when assessing the impact of RG selection on target gene expression quantification, substantial differences in target gene expression profiles were observed. Altogether, by assessing mRNA expression profiles within the neonatal rat brain cortex in hypoxia and hypothermia as a showcase, this study underlines the importance of further validating RGs for each individual experimental paradigm, considering the limitations of the statistical methods used for this aim.},

abstract = {Background: Until recently ovarian carcinoma was considered to be a single disease, and treatment decisions were based solely on grade and pre- and postoperative tumour burden. New insights into molecular features, treatment response, and patient demographics led the scientific community to conclude that ovarian carcinoma histotypes are different disease entities. Methods: In 2002, the pathology specimens from patients in a clinical trial were reviewed by an experienced gynaecopathologist (pathologist A) for translational research purposes. All cases were typed according to what were then current criteria. The identical cohort was now reassessed by the same expert pathologist and independently reviewed by another gynaecopathologist (pathologist B) applying WHO 2014 diagnostic criteria. Survival analyses were done based on the original as well as the new diagnoses, and historical biomarker study results were recalculated. Results: Upon re-review, pathologist A rendered the same histotype diagnosis in only 54% of cases. In contrast, pathologists A and B independently rendered the same diagnosis in 98% of cases. Histotype was of prognostic significance when 2014 diagnoses were used, but was not prognostic using the original (2002) histotype diagnoses. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates a marked shift in ovarian carcinoma histotype diagnosis over the past 15 years. The new criteria are associated with a very high degree of interobserver reproducibility, allowing for treatment decisions based on histotype. Finally, biomarkers of putative prognostic significance were revealed to be primarily histotype-specific markers, confirming the critical importance of obtaining up-to-date diagnoses rather than accepting archival histotype data in clinical research.},

abstract = {Objective: Ovarian cancer (OC) was one of the deadliest gynecological malignancy among women in global. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) could serve as promising diagnostic biomarkers for patients with OC. Study design: Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) based Exiqon panel, we identified 27 differentially expressed miRNAs from one normal control (NC) pool and two OC pool samples in the initial screening stage. We further verified the miRNAs in the training (30 OC VS. 36 NCs) and validation stages (80 OC VS. 80 NCs) based on qRT-PCR. Later, the expression levels of the identified miRNAs were also evaluated in exosomes and tissues. Results: We found a serum microRNA signature including five overexpressed miRNAs (miR-200c-3p, miR-346, miR-127-3p, miR-143-3p and miR-205-5p) in OC in comparison with NCs. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of the five-miRNA panel were 0.783 for the training stage and 0.745 for the validation stage. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the combined five-miRNA panel was 0.818 and 0.609 when the cut-off value was 0.636. The levels of miR-200c-3p, miR-346 and miR-127-3p in serum were related to tumor grade and distant metastasis of OC. The expression levels of the five miRNAs were also significantly up-regulated in serum exosomes (32 OC VS. 32 NCs). Furthermore, miR-200c-3p was significantly elevated in OC tissues (22 OC VS. 22 NCs). But the levels of the miR-346 and miR-143-3p were significantly lower in OC tissues. Conclusion: Our findings showed a five-miRNA panel in serum for the detection of OC. Moreover, serum expression levels of miR-200c-3p, miR-346 and miR-127-3p were concerned with tumor grade and distant metastasis of OC.},

abstract = {miRNet is an easy-to-use, web-based platform designed to help elucidate microRNA (miRNA) functions by integrating users' data with existing knowledge via network-based visual analytics. Since its first release in 2016, miRNet has been accessed by >20 000 researchers worldwide, with ∼100 users on a daily basis. While version 1.0 was focused primarily on miRNA-target gene interactions, it has become clear that in order to obtain a global view of miRNA functions, it is necessary to bring other important players into the context during analysis. Driven by this concept, in miRNet version 2.0, we have (i) added support for transcription factors (TFs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect miRNAs, miRNA-binding sites or target genes, whilst also greatly increased (>5-fold) the underlying knowledgebases of miRNAs, ncRNAs and disease associations; (ii) implemented new functions to allow creation and visual exploration of multipartite networks, with enhanced support for in situ functional analysis and (iii) revamped the web interface, optimized the workflow, and introduced microservices and web application programming interface (API) to sustain high-performance, real-time data analysis. The underlying R package is also released in tandem with version 2.0 to allow more flexible data analysis for R programmers. The miRNet 2.0 website is freely available at https://www.mirnet.ca.},

abstract = {Background: Ovarian cancer is the leading lethal gynecological cancer and is generally diagnosed during late-stage presentation. In addition, patients with ovarian cancer still face a low 5-year survival rate. Thus, innovative molecular targeting agents are required to overcome this disease. The present study aimed to explore the function of miR-362-3p and the underlying molecular mechanisms influencing ovarian cancer progression. Methods: The expression levels of miR-362-3p were determined using qRT-PCR. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function methods were used to detect the effects of miR-362-3p on cell proliferation, cell migration, and tumor metastasis in ovarian cancer. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the potential target of miR-362-3p, and a rescue experiment was employed to verify the effect of miR-362-3p on ovarian cancer by regulating its target gene. Results: miR-362-3p was significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. In vitro, our data showed that miR-362-3p suppressed cell proliferation and migration. In vivo, miR-362-3p inhibited ovarian cancer growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, SERBP1 was identified as a direct target and functional effector of miR-362-3p in ovarian cancer. Moreover, SERBP1 overexpression rescued the biological function of miR-362-3p. Conclusions: Our data reveal that miR-362-3p has an inhibitory effect on ovarian cancer. miR-362-3p inhibits the development and progression of ovarian cancer by directly binding its target gene SERBP1.},

abstract = {Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a common gynecological cancer and characterized by high metastatic potential. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) have the promise to be harnessed as prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers for OC. Herein, we sought to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs in metastatic OC, and to validate them with functional experiments. Methods: Differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs were screened from six pairs of primary OC tissues and metastatic tissues using a miRStar™ Human Cancer Focus miRNA and Target mRNA PCR Array. Then, gene expression profiling results were verified by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot assays. The binding affinity between miR-7-5p and TGF$\beta$2 was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Expression of miR-7-5p and TGF$\beta$2 was manipulated to assess their roles in malignant phenotypes of highly metastatic HO-8910PM cells. Results: MiRNA profiling and sequencing identified 12 miRNAs and 10 mRNAs that were differentially expressed in metastatic tissues. Gene ontology and Pathway analyses determined that 3 differentially expressed mRNAs (ITGB3, TGF$\beta$2 and TNC) were related to OC metastasis. The results of RT-qPCR confirmed that the decrease of miR-7-5p was most significant in OC metastasis, while TGF$\beta$2 was up-regulated in OC metastasis. Moreover, miR-7-5p targeted and negatively regulated TGF$\beta$2. MiR-7-5p overexpression accelerated HO-8910PM cell viability and invasion, and TGF$\beta$2 overexpression reversed the results. Meanwhile, simultaneous miR-7-5p and TGF$\beta$2 overexpression rescued the cell activities. Conclusions: This study characterizes differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs in metastatic OC, where miR-7-5p and its downstream target were most closely associated with metastatic OC. Overexpression of miR-7-5p targets and inhibits TGF$\beta$2 expression, thereby inhibiting the growth and metastasis of OC.},

abstract = {Background: Improved insight into the molecular characteristics of the different ovarian cancer subgroups is needed for developing a more individualized and optimized treatment regimen. The aim of this study was to a) identify differentially expressed miRNAs in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC), clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCC) and ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), b) evaluate selected miRNAs for association with clinical parameters including survival and c) map miRNA-mRNA interactions.Methods: Differences in miRNA expression between HGSC, CCC and OSE were analyzed by global miRNA expression profiling (Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 2.0 Arrays, n = 12, 9 and 9, respectively), validated by RT-qPCR (n = 35, 19 and 9, respectively), and evaluated for associations with clinical parameters. For HGSC, differentially expressed miRNAs were linked to differentially expressed mRNAs identified previously.Results: Differentially expressed miRNAs (n = 78) between HGSC, CCC and OSE were identified (FDR < 0.01%), of which 18 were validated (p < 0.01) using RT-qPCR in an extended cohort. Compared with OSE, miR-205-5p was the most overexpressed miRNA in HGSC. miR-200 family members and miR-182-5p were the most overexpressed in HGSC and CCC compared with OSE, whereas miR-383 was the most underexpressed. miR-205-5p and miR-200 members target epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators, apparently being important in tumor progression. miR-509-3-5p, miR-509-5p, miR-509-3p and miR-510 were among the strongest differentiators between HGSC and CCC, all being significantly overexpressed in CCC compared with HGSC. High miR-200c-3p expression was associated with poor progression-free (p = 0.031) and overall (p = 0.026) survival in HGSC patients. Interacting miRNA and mRNA targets, including those of a TP53-related pathway presented previously, were identified in HGSC.Conclusions: Several miRNAs differentially expressed between HGSC, CCC and OSE have been identified, suggesting a carcinogenetic role for these miRNAs. miR-200 family members, targeting EMT drivers, were mostly overexpressed in both subgroups, among which miR-200c-3p was associated with survival in HGSC patients. A set of miRNAs differentiates CCC from HGSC, of which miR-509-3-5p and miR-509-5p are the strongest classifiers. Several interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs in HGSC were mapped. {\textcopyright} 2014 Vilming Elgaaen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: MiR-182-5p, a cancer-related microRNA (miRNA), modulates tumorigenesis and patient outcomes in various human malignances. This study interroted the clinicopathological significance and molecular mechanisms of miR-182-5p in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: The clinical significance of miR-182-5p in NSCLC subtypes was determined based on an analysis of 124 samples (lung adenocarcinomas [LUADs], n = 101; lung squamous cell carcinomas [LUSCs], n = 23) obtained from NSCLC patients and paired noncancer tissues and an analysis of data obtained from public miRNA-seq database, miRNA-chip database, and the scientific literature. The NSCLC samples (n = 124) were analyzed using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Potential targets of miR-182-5p were identified using lists generated by miRWalk v.2.0, a comprehensive atlas of predicted and validated targets of miRNA-target interactions. Molecular events of miR-182-5p in NSCLC were unveiled based on a functional analysis of candidate targets. The association of miR-182-5p with one of the candidate target genes, homeobox A9 (HOXA9), was validated using in-house RT-qPCR and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Results: The results of the in-house RT-qPCR assays analysis of data obtained from public miRNA-seq databases, miRNA-chip databases, and the scientific literature all supported upregulation of the expression level of miR-182-5p level in NSCLC. Moreover, the in-house RT-qPCR data supported the influence of upregulated miR-182-5p on malignant progression of NSCLC. In total, 774 prospective targets of miR-182-5p were identified. These targets were mainly clustered in pathways associated with biological processes, such as axonogenesis, axonal development, and Ras protein signal transduction, as well as pathways involved in axonal guidance, melanogenesis, and longevity regulation, in multiple species. Correlation analysis of the in-house RT-qPCR data and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that HOXA9 was a direct target of miR-182-5p in NSCLC. Conclusions: The miR-182-5p expression level was upregulated in NSCLC tissues. MiR-182-5p may exert oncogenic influence on NSCLC through regulating target genes such as HOXA9.},

abstract = {Cell-free microRNAs in plasma and serum have become a promising source of biomarkers for various diseases. Despite rapid progress in this field, there remains a lack of consensus regarding optimal quantification methods, reference genes, and quality control of samples. Recent studies have shown that hemolysis occurring during blood collection has substantial impact on the microRNA content in plasma/serum. To date, the impact of hemolysis has only been investigated for a limited number of microRNAs, mainly the red blood cell (RBC)-enriched miRs-16 and -451. In contrast, the effect of hemolysis on other microRNAs - in particular those proposed as biomarkers - has not been addressed. In this study we profiled the microRNA content of hemolyzed and non-hemolyzed plasma as well as RBCs to obtain a profile of microRNAs in the circulation affected or unaffected by hemolysis. Profiling by TaqMan Array Microfluidic Cards was used to compare three pairs of hemolyzed and non-hemolyzed plasma (with varying degrees of hemolysis) and one RBC sample. A total of 136 microRNAs were detectable in at least two of the samples, and of those 15 were at least twofold elevated in all three hemolyzed samples. This number increased to 88 microRNAs for the sample with the highest level of hemolysis, with all of these also detected in the RBC profile. Thus these microRNAs represent a large proportion of detectable microRNAs and those most likely to be affected by hemolysis. Several of the hemolysis-susceptible microRNAs (e.g., miRs-21, -106a, -92a, -17, -16) have also been previously proposed as plasma/serum biomarkers of disease, highlighting the importance of rigorous quality control of plasma/serum samples used for measurement of circulating microRNAs. As low-level hemolysis is a frequent occurrence during plasma/serum collection it is critical that this is taken into account in the measurement of any candidate circulating microRNA.},

Many of these methods are oriented towards the expression analysis of mature miRNAs and few are designed for the study of pre-miRNAs and pri-miRNAs.

abstract = {Background Urotensin II (UII) is a new vasoconstrictive peptide that may activate the adventitial fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (TGF-$\beta$1) is an important factor that could induce the phenotypical transdifferentiation of adventitial fibroblasts. This study aimed to explore whether TGF-$\beta$1 is involved in UII-induced phenotypic differentiation of adventitial fibroblasts from rat aorta. Methods Adventitial fibroblasts were prepared by the explant culture method. TGF-$\beta$1 protein secretion from the cells was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA and protein expression of $\alpha$-SMooth nuscle actin ($\alpha$-SM-actin), the marker of phenotypic differentiation from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, were determined using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (real-time RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. Results UII stimulated the secretion of TGF-$\beta$1 in cultured adventitial fibroblasts in a time-dependent manner. The secretion reached a peak at 24 hours, was higher by 69.8% (P <0.01), than the control group. This effect was also concentration dependent. Maximal stimulation was reached at 10 -8 mol/L of UII (P <0.01), which was increased by 59.9%, compared with in the control group (P <0.01). The secretion of TGF-$\beta$1 induced by UII was significantly blocked by SB-710411 (10 -7 mol/L), a specific antagonist of UII receptor. In addition, both UII (10 -8 mol/L) and TGF-$\beta$1 significantly stimulated $\alpha$-SM-actin mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, the $\alpha$-SM-actin induced by UII was inhibited by the specific neutralizing antibody (20 ug/ml) of TGF-$\beta$1, while the $\alpha$-SM-actin expression stimulated by TGF-$\beta$1 (20 ng/ml) was inhibited by SB-710411 (10 7 mol/L), the UII receptor antagonist. Conclusion This study suggests that UII could induce TGF-$\beta$1 secretion in adventitial fibroblasts via UT activation, and TGF-$\beta$1 might be involved in phenotypic differentiation from adventitial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts induced by UII, and TGF-p1 signaling might be one of the important pathways by which UII is involved in vascular fibrosis.},

abstract = {Cell-free microRNAs have been reported as biomarkers for several diseases. For testicular germ cell tumors (GCT), circulating microRNAs 371a-3p and 372-3p in serum and plasma have been proposed as biomarkers for diagnostic and disease monitoring purposes. The most widely used method for quantification of specific microRNAs in serum and plasma is reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) by the comparative Ct-method. In this method one or several reference genes or reference microRNAs are needed in order to normalize and calculate the relative microRNA levels across samples. One of the pitfalls in analysis of microRNAs from serum and plasma is the release of microRNAs from blood cells during hemolysis. This is an important issue because varying degrees of hemolysis are not uncommon in routine blood sampling. Thus, hemolysis must be taken into consideration when working with circulating microRNAs from blood. miR-93-5p, miR-30b-5p, and miR-20a-5p have been reported as reference microRNA in analysis of the miR-371a-373 cluster. We here show how these three microRNAs are influenced by hemolysis. We also propose a new reference microRNA, miR-191-5p, which is relatively stable in serum samples with mild hemolysis. In addition, we show how hemolysis can have effect on the reported microRNA levels in patient samples when these reference microRNAs are used in samples with varying levels of hemolysis.},

The video camera detects the accumulation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in each PCR using the increase in the fluorescence of ethidium bromide (EtBr) that results from its binding duplex DNA. The kinetics of fluorescence accumulation during thermocycling are directly related to the starting number of DNA copies. The fewer cycles necessary to produce a detectable fluorescence, the greater the number of target sequences. Results obtained with this approach indicate that a kinetic approach to PCR analysis can quantitate DNA sensitively, selectively and over a large dynamic range. This approach also provides a means of determining the effect of different reaction conditions on the efficacy of the amplification and so can provide insight into fundamental PCR processes. {\textcopyright} 1993 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) and Potato mop top virus (PMTV) are important diseases of potato that are difficult to diagnose reliably by visual symptoms. Effective control strategies rely on accurate diagnosis. This paper describes the development of a multiplex assay for the detection of TRV and PMTV directly from potato tubers and leaves by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with in-tube fluorescent product detection (TaqMan). This technology obviates any post-PCR manipulations and has many advantages including reducing contamination risks, eliminating the need for ethidium bromide staining, and removing the time and cost of gel running. The new assay also allows the replacement of the two separate tests (a TRV reverse-transcription-PCR and a PMTV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) currently used with a single-tube multiplex format. In addition to greatly simplifying the detection of these two viruses, the multiplex TaqMan assay was also shown to be more sensitive than either of the tests that it replaces, allowing 100- and 10,000-fold increases in sensitivity for TRV and PMTV detection, respectively. The test reliably detected over 40 different isolates of TRV and PMTV obtained from a wide range of different cultivars and geographical locations, including some samples in which existing tests failed to detect virus. The use of an assay of this kind in routine diagnosis helps to speed up and streamline the diagnostic laboratory; in addition, more reliable diagnosis should help in the control of this damaging disease.},

abstract = {RNA quality is of utmost importance to perform gene expression quantification by qPCR. The classical methods used to determine RNA quality are based on electrophoresis and spectrophotometer assessment, namely A260/A280 and A260/A230 ratios. It was previously shown that due to the complex nature of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms, RNA extraction procedures could impact mRNA quality and thus accurate quantification. Herein, we contaminated and degraded RNA extracted from S. epidermidis biofilms, and assessed the effect on gene expression by qPCR. As expected, thermal degradation of RNA had a significant impact on gene expression on two out of the three tested genes. On the other hand, the contamination of the extracted RNA yielded an interesting result: while most contaminants did not changed the purity indicators or the integrity of RNA, significant changes on gene expression levels were found. This work confirms that poor RNA extraction has an important impact in qPCR quantification, emphasizing the consequences of carry-over contaminants on gene expression studies. Additionally, our results show that the parameters commonly used to assess the quality of extracted RNA from bacterial cultures seem to be insufficient to ensure reliable gene expression determination. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {There is a lack of systematic research on the expression of internal control genes used for gene expression normalization in real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in spinal cord injury research. In this study, we used rat models of spinal cord hemisection to analyze the expression stability of 13 commonly applied reference genes: Actb, Ankrd27, CypA, Gapdh, Hprt1, Mrpl10, Pgk1, Rictor, Rn18s, Tbp, Ubc, Ubxn11, and Ywhaz. Our results show that the expression of Ankrd27, Ubc, and Tbp were stable after spinal cord injury, while Actb was the most unstable internal control gene. Ankrd27, Ubc, Tbp, and Actb were consequently used to investigate the effects of internal control genes with differing stabilities on the normalization of target gene expression. Target gene expression levels and changes over time were similar when Ankrd27, Ubc, and Tbp were used as internal controls but different when Actb was used as an internal control. We recommend that Ankrd27, Ubc, and Tbp are used as internal control genes for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in spinal cord injury research. This study was approved by the Administration Committee of Experimental Animals, Jiangsu Province, China (approval No. 20180304-008) on March 4, 2018.},

Several cardiac miRNAs are detectable in circulation (circulating miRNAs; c-miRNAs) and are emerging as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for CVDs. c-miRNAs exhibit numerous essential characteristics of biomarkers while they are extremely stable in circulation, their expression is tissue-/disease-specific, and they can be easily detected using sequence-specific amplification methods. These features of c-miRNAs are helpful in the development of non-invasive assays to monitor the progress of CVDs. Despite significant progress in the detection of c-miRNAs in serum and plasma, there are many contradictory publications on the alterations of cardiac c-miRNAs concentration in circulation. The aim of this review is to examine the pre-analytical and analytical factors affecting the quantification of c-miRNAs and provide general guidelines to increase the accuracy of the diagnostic tests in order to improve future research on cardiac c-miRNAs.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine the utility of serum miRNAs as biomarkers for epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer were identified from a tissue and serum bank. Serum was collected prior to definitive therapy. Fifteen unmatched, healthy controls were used for comparison. Serum was obtained from all patients. RNA was extracted using a derivation of the single step Trizol method. The RNA from 9 cancer specimens was compared to 4 normal specimens with real-time PCR using the TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA panel. Twenty-one miRNAs were differentially expressed between normal and patient serum. Real-time PCR for the 21 individual miRNAs was performed on the remaining 19 cancer specimens and 11 normal specimens. Results: Eight miRNAs of the original twenty-one were identified that were significantly differentially expressed between cancer and normal specimens using the comparative Ct method. MiRNAs-21, 92, 93, 126 and 29a were significantly over-expressed in the serum from cancer patients compared to controls (p < .01). MiRNAs-155, 127 and 99b were significantly under-expressed (p < .01). Additionally, miRs-21, 92 and 93 were over-expressed in 3 patients with normal pre-operative CA-125. Conclusion: We demonstrate that the extraction of RNA and subsequent identification of miRNAs from the serum of individuals diagnosed with ovarian cancer is feasible. Real-time PCR-based microarray is a novel and practical means to performing high-throughput investigation of serum RNA samples. miRNAs-21, 92 and 93 are known oncogenes with therapeutic and biomarker potential. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {miRNAs are small molecules involved in gene regulation. Each tissue shows a characteristic miRNAs epression profile that could be altered during neoplastic transformation. Glioblastoma is the most aggressive brain tumour of the adult with a high rate of mortality. Recognizing a specific pattern of miRNAs for GBM could provide further boost for target therapy. The availability of fresh tissue for brain specimens is often limited and for this reason the possibility of starting from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) could very helpful even in miRNAs expression analysis. We analysed a panel of 19 miRNAs in 30 paired samples starting both from FFPE and Fresh/Frozen material. Our data revealed that there is a good correlation in results obtained from FFPE in comparison with those obtained analysing miRNAs extracted from Fresh/Frozen specimen. In the few cases with a not good correlation value we noticed that the discrepancy could be due to dissection performed in FFPE samples. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper demonstrating that the results obtained in miRNAs analysis using Real-Time PCR starting from FFPE specimens of glioblastoma are comparable with those obtained in Fresh/Frozen samples. {\textcopyright} 2012 de Biase et al.},

abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide and, despite advances in detection and therapies, it still represents the most lethal gynecologic malignancy in the industrialized countries. Unfortunately, still relatively little is known about the molecular events that lead to the development of this highly aggressive disease. The relatively recent discovery of micro-RNAs (miRNA), a class of small noncoding RNAs targeting multiple mRNAs and triggering translation repression and/or RNA degradation, has revealed the existence of a new level of gene expression regulation. Multiple studies involving various types of human cancers proved that miRNAs have a causal role in tumorigenesis. Here we show that, in comparison to normal ovary, miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in human ovarian cancer. The overall miRNA expression could clearly separate normal versus cancer tissues. The most significantly overexpressed miRNAs were miR-200a, miR-141, miR-200c, and miR-200b, whereas miR-199a, miR-140, miR-145, and miR-125b1 were among the most down-modulated miRNAs. We could also identify miRNAs whose expression was correlated with specific ovarian cancer biopathologic features, such as histotype, lymphovascular and organ invasion, and involvement of ovarian surface. Moreover, the levels of miR-21, miR-203, and miR-205, up-modulated in ovarian carcinomas compared with normal tissues, were significantly increased after 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine demethylating treatment of OVCAR3 cells, suggesting that the DNA hypomethylation could be the mechanism responsible for their overexpression. Our results indicate that miRNAs might play a role in the pathogenesis of human EOC and identify altered miRNA gene methylation as a possible epigenetic mechanism involved in their aberrant expression. {\textcopyright}2007 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths among women. Due to the asymptomatic tumor progression and lack of efficient screening methods, majority of OC patients are diagnosed in advanced tumor stages. A combination of surgical resection and platinum based-therapy is the common treatment option for advanced OC patients. However, tumor relapse is observed in about 70% of cases due to the treatment failure. Cisplatin is widely used as an efficient first-line treatment option for OC; however cisplatin resistance is observed in a noticeable ratio of cases. Regarding, the severe cisplatin side effects, it is required to clarify the molecular biology of cisplatin resistance to improve the clinical outcomes of OC patients. Cisplatin resistance in OC is associated with abnormal drug transportation, increased detoxification, abnormal apoptosis, and abnormal DNA repair ability. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical factors involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and chemo resistance. MiRNAs as non-invasive and more stable factors compared with mRNAs, can be introduced as efficient markers of cisplatin response in OC patients. Main body: In present review, we have summarized all of the miRNAs that have been associated with cisplatin resistance in OC. We also categorized the miRNAs based on their targets to clarify their probable molecular mechanisms during cisplatin resistance in ovarian tumor cells. Conclusions: It was observed that miRNAs mainly exert their role in cisplatin response through regulation of apoptosis, signaling pathways, and transcription factors in OC cells. This review highlighted the miRNAs as important regulators of cisplatin response in ovarian tumor cells. Moreover, present review paves the way of suggesting a non-invasive panel of prediction markers for cisplatin response among OC patients.},

Regardless of outstanding advances, which have been made for improving the prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian cancer, the majority of the patients will die of the disease. Late-stage diagnosis and the occurrence of recurrent cancer after treatment are the most important causes of the high mortality rate observed in ovarian cancer patients. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer may help find new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression, mostly at the posttranscriptional stage, through binding to mRNA targets and inducing translational repression or degradation of target via the RNA-induced silencing complex. Over the last two decades, the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of various human cancers, including ovarian cancer, has been documented in multiple studies. Consequently, these small RNAs could be considered as reliable markers for prognosis and early diagnosis. Furthermore, given the function of miRNAs in various cellular pathways, including cell survival and differentiation, targeting miRNAs could be an interesting approach for the treatment of human cancers. Here, we review our current understanding of the most updated role of the important dysregulation of miRNAs and their roles in the progression and metastasis of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, we meticulously discuss the significance of miRNAs as prognostic and diagnostic markers. Lastly, we mention the opportunities and the efforts made for targeting ovarian cancer through inhibition and/or stimulation of the miRNAs.},

abstract = {Background: An appropriate normalization strategy is crucial for data analysis from real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-qPCR). It is widely supported to identify and validate stable reference genes, since no single biological gene is stably expressed between cell types or within cells under different conditions. Different algorithms exist to validate optimal reference genes for normalization. Applying human cells, we here compare the three main methods to the online available RefFinder tool that integrates these algorithms along with R-based software packages which include the NormFinder and GeNorm algorithms. Results: 14 candidate reference genes were assessed by RT-qPCR in two sample sets, i.e. a set of samples of human testicular tissue containing carcinoma in situ (CIS), and a set of samples from the human adult Sertoli cell line (FS1) either cultured alone or in co-culture with the seminoma like cell line (TCam-2) or with equine bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (eBM-MSC). Expression stabilities of the reference genes were evaluated using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. Similar results were obtained by the three approaches for the most and least stably expressed genes. The R-based packages NormqPCR, SLqPCR and the NormFinder for R script gave identical gene rankings. Interestingly, different outputs were obtained between the original software packages and the RefFinder tool, which is based on raw Cq values for input. When the raw data were reanalysed assuming 100% efficiency for all genes, then the outputs of the original software packages were similar to the RefFinder software, indicating that RefFinder outputs may be biased because PCR efficiencies are not taken into account. Conclusions: This report shows that assay efficiency is an important parameter for reference gene validation. New software tools that incorporate these algorithms should be carefully validated prior to use.},

abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a highly lethal gynecological malignancy, and cisplatin resistance is usually correlated with the poor prognosis of EOC. Increasing evidence indicates that the dysregulation of miRNAs is related to chemotherapy sensitivity. In this study, we revealed that miR-98-5p, a member of the let-7 family, was enriched in cisplatin-resistant EOC cells compared with cisplatin-sensitive cells, and could promote cisplatin resistance in EOC cells. Further studies showed that miR-98-5p could directly target the 3′-UTR of Dicer1 and suppress its expression, causing global miRNA downregulation. By miRNA array and qRT-PCR verification, we identified miR-152 as the vital downstream target of the miR-98-5p/Dicer1 axis in EOC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the ectopic expression of miR-152 reversed cisplatin resistance both in vitro and in vivo by targeting RAD51, a central member in homologous recombination. Importantly, miR-98-5p expression, as determined by in situ hybridization in tumor tissues, was associated with poor outcome of EOC patients. Together, these findings suggest the essential role of the miR-98-5p/Dicer1/miR-152 pathway in regulating cisplatin resistance of EOC cells and provide a potential target for EOC therapy.},

A variety of in vitro cell culture settings with primary human hepatocytes, and Huh-7 and HepG2 cell lines, were used to determine candidate RG expression stability in RT-qPCR analyses. Employing GeNorm, BestKeeper and Normfinder algorithms, this study identifies PSMB6, MDH1 and some more RG as sufficiently unregulated, thus expressed at stable levels, in hepatocyte-like cells in vitro. Inclusion of multiple RG, quenching occasional regulations of single RG, greatly stabilises gene expression level calculations from RT-qPCR data. To further enhance validity and reproducibility of relative RT-qPCR quantifications, the $\Delta$CT calculation can be extended (e-$\Delta$CT) by replacing the CT of a single RG in $\Delta$CT with an averaged CT-value from multiple RG. The use of two or three RG - here identified suited for human hepatocyte-like cells - for normalisation with the straightforward e-$\Delta$CT calculation, should improve reproducibility and robustness of comparative RT-qPCR-based gene expression analyses. {\textcopyright} 2014 Riedel et al.},

abstract = {Advanced ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological tumor, mainly due to late diagnoses and acquired drug resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small-non coding RNA acting as tumor suppressor/oncogenes differentially expressed in normal and epithelial ovarian cancer and has been recognized as a new class of tumor early detection biomarkers as they are released in blood fluids since tumor initiation process. Here, we evaluated by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) circulating miRNAs in serum samples from healthy (N = 105) and untreated ovarian cancer patients (stages I to IV) (N = 72), grouped into a discovery/ training and clinical validation set with the goal to identify the best classifier allowing the discrimination between earlier ovarian tumors from health controls women. The selection of 45 candidate miRNAs to be evaluated in the discovery set was based on miRNAs represented in ovarian cancer explorative commercial panels. We found six miRNAs showing increased levels in the blood of early or late-stage ovarian cancer groups compared to healthy controls. The serum levels of miR-320b and miR-141-3p were considered independent markers of malignancy in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. These markers were used to train diagnostic classifiers comprising miRNAs (miR-320b and miR-141-3p) and miRNAs combined with well-established ovarian cancer protein markers (miR-320b, miR-141-3p, CA- 125 and HE4). The miRNA-based classifier was able to accurately discriminate early-stage ovarian cancer patients from health-controls in an independent sample set (Sensitivity = 80.0%, Specificity = 70.3%, AUC = 0.789). In addition, the integration of the serum proteins in the model markedly improved the performance (Sensitivity = 88.9%, Specificity = 100%, AUC = 1.000). A cross-study validation was carried out using four data series obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), corroborating the performance of the miRNA-based classifier (AUCs ranging from 0.637 to 0.979). The clinical utility of the miRNA model should be validated in a prospective cohort in order to investigate their feasibility as an ovarian cancer early detection tool.},

MiR-363expression was downregulated in OC patient tissues and four OC cell lines (SKOV3, A2780, OVCAR and HO-8910). Low miR-363 levels were associated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in OC. MiR-363 overexpression decreased growth, colony formation, migration and invasiveness of SKOV3 cells. In addition, miR-363 overexpression in SKOV3 cells also decreased xenograft tumor size and weight in nude mice. Bioinformatics and dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-363 suppresses expression of NIN1/ RPN12 binding protein 1 homolog (NOB1) by binding to the 3'-UTR of its transcript. NOB1 expression inversely correlated with miR-363 levels in OC tissues. Thus miR- 363 appears to play a tumor suppressor role in OC by inhibiting NOB1.},

In this study, it was indicated that miR-363 downregulation was significantly correlated with EOC carcinogenesis and cisplatin resistance. Moreover, miR-363 overexpression could resensitise cisplatin-resistant EOC cells to cisplatin treatment both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, data revealed that EMT inducer Snail was significantly upregulated in cisplatin-resistant EOC cell lines and EOC patients and was a functional target of miR-363 in EOC cells. Furthermore, snail overexpression could significantly attenuate miR-363-suppressed cisplatin resistance of EOC cells, suggesting that miR-363-regulated cisplatin resistance is mediated by snail-induced EMT in EOC cells. Taken together, findings suggest that miR-363 may be a biomarker for predicting responsiveness to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and a potential therapeutic target in EOC.},

abstract = {Background: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies among women worldwide. Early diagnosis of EOC could help in ovarian cancer management. MicroRNAs, a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, are known to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of $\sim$60% of human genes. Aberrantly expressed miRNAs associated with disease progression are confined in lipid or lipoprotein and secreted as extracellular miRNA in body fluid such as plasma, serum, and urine. MiRNAs are stably present in the circulation and recently have gained an importance to serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: Genome-wide methylation pattern of six EOC and two normal ovarian tissue samples revealed differential methylation regions of miRNA gene promoter through MeDIP-NGS sequencing. Based on log2FC and p-value, three hypomethylated miRNAs (miR-205, miR-200c, and miR-141) known to have a potential role in ovarian cancer progression were selected for expression analysis through qRT-PCR. The expression of selected miRNAs was analyzed in 115 tissue (85 EOC, 30 normal) and 65 matched serum (51 EOC and 14 normal) samples. Results: All three miRNAs (miR-205, miR-200c, and miR-141) showed significantly higher expression in both tissue and serum cohorts when compared with normal controls (p < 0.0001). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of miR-205, miR-200c, and miR-141 has area under the curve (AUC) values of 87.6 (p < 0.0001), 78.2 (p < 0.0001), and 86.0 (p < 0.0001), respectively; in advance-stage serum samples, however, ROC has AUC values of 88.1 (p < 0.0001), 78.9 (p < 0.0001), and 86.7 (p < 0.0001), respectively, in early-stage serum samples. The combined diagnostic potential of the three miRNAs in advance-stage serum samples and early-stage serum samples has AUC values of 95.9 (95% CI: 0.925–1.012; sensitivity = 96.6% and specificity = 80.0%) and 98.1 (95% CI: 0.941–1.021; sensitivity = 90.5% and specificity = 100%), respectively. Conclusion: Our data correlate the epigenetic deregulation of the miRNA genes with their expression. In addition, the miRNA panel (miR-205 + miR-200c + miR-141) has a much higher AUC, sensitivity, and specificity to predict EOC at an early stage in both tissue and serum samples.},

abstract = {Ovarian cancer as the most fatal gynecological malignancy is often manifested by excessive fluid accumulation known as ascites or effusion. Ascites-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) may be closely associated with ovarian cancer progression. However, our knowledge of their roles, altered expression, and clinical outcomes remained limited. In this study, large-scale expression profiling of 754 human miRNAs was performed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 384-well TaqMan array human miRNA A and B cards to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between extracellular fraction of the ascitic fluid associated with high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas and control plasma. Of the 754 miRNAs, 153 were significantly differentially expressed relative to the controls. Expression of 7 individual miRNAs (miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, miR-429, miR-1290, and miR-30a-5p) was further validated in extended sample sets, including serous, endometrioid, and mucinous subtypes. All miR-200 family members and miR-1290 were conspicuously overexpressed, while miR-30a-5p was only weakly overexpressed. The ability of miRNAs expression to discriminate the pathological samples from the controls was strong. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses found area under the curve (AUC) values of 1.000 for miR-200a, miR-200c, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-1290 and of AUC 0.996 and 0.885 for miR-200b and miR-30a-5p, respectively. Preliminary survival analyses indicated low expression level of miR-200b as significantly related to longer overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.25, mean survival 44 months), while high expression level was related to poor overall survival (HR: 4.04, mean survival 24 months). Our findings suggested that ascites-derived miRNAs should be further explored and evaluated as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer.},

Materials and Methods: The authors used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect the expression of miR-145, miR-143, miR-146a, miR-93, miR-29a, miR-18a, and miR-200a in tissues of 56 primary SOC patients and 30 benign lesion patients. Four protein (MUC1, FAP, MMP2, MMP9) expressions were identified by western blotting and immunohistochemical stain. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the relationship of these miRNAs with overall survival rate. Results: In SOC tissue, expression of miR-200a, miR-93, miR-146a, and miR-18a were up-regulated, while miR-145, miR-143, miR-29a were down-regulated. MUC1, FAP, MMP2, and MMP9 were overexpressed in SOC. MiR-143 or miR-145 higher expressed patients had significantly higher overall survival (OS) rates, while miR-93 or miR-200a lower expressed patients also had higher OS rates. Discussion: These results suggested that several miRNAs and their regulated target transcripts may have important roles in the initiation and development of SOC. MiR-145/miR-143, miR-200a, and miR-93 could be used as prognostic biomarkers.},

High-grade serous carcinoma effusions (n = 148) were analyzed for expression of miR-29a, miR-31, miR-99b, miR-182, miR-210, miR-221, miR-222, miR-224, and miR-342 using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Expression levels were analyzed for association with clinicopathological parameters and survival. miR-29a and miR-31 levels were further assessed for association with protein expression of their targets Stathmin and DNA methyltransferase-3A (DNMT3A) by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. miRNA levels were unrelated to clinicopathological parameters. However, higher miR-29a levels were significantly related to longer overall survival in univariate (P =.007) and Cox multivariate survival analysis (P =.045). miR-29a levels were inversely related to those of its target DNMT3A (P =.048), and higher DNMT3A expression was significantly related to poor overall survival in univariate (P =.03) and Cox multivariate (P =.016) survival analysis. In contrast, miR-31 levels were directly related to cytoplasmic phospho-Stathmin expression (P =.029) and unrelated to Stathmin and nuclear phospho-Stathmin, and both Stathmin and phospho-Stathmin expressions were unrelated to survival. miR-29a and its target DNMT3A are novel candidate biomarkers of longer and shorter survival, respectively, in metastatic high-grade serous carcinoma.},

abstract = {Previous studies have identified microRNA (miRNA) involvement in human cancers. This study aimed to elucidate potential clinical and biological associations of ovarian cancerrelated miRNA gene expression profiles in high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) and ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC). Accordingly, we investigated 27 patients with ovarian cancer (12 HGSC and 15 OCCC cases) using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to determine the cancer-relatedmiRNA expressions. Gene Cluster 3.0 was used for hierarchical clustering analysis, and differentially expressed miRNAs between HGSC and OCCC were identified by the class comparison analysis using BRBArrayTools. An unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis identified two distinct miRNA expression clusters, with histological subtype-related significant differences in the associations between clusters and clinicopathological features. A comparison of miRNA expression in HGSCs and OCCCs identified five miRNAs (miR-132, miR-9, miR-126, miR-34a, and miR-21), with OCCCs demonstrating a statistically higher expression. Further investigation of the biological significance of miR-9 overexpression in OCCC revealed that miR-9 inhibition reduced the cell invasion ability and upregulated E-cadherin expression. Using a luciferase reporterassay, we further demonstrated the direct binding of miR-9 to E-cadherin. Global cancer-related miRNA expression analysis identified statistically unique profiles that could discriminate ovarian cancer histotypes. In OCCC, miR-9 overexpression may affect pathogenesis by targeting E-cadherin, thereby inducing an epithelial'mesenchymal transition. Therefore, miR-9 may be a promising therapeutic target strategy for OCCC.},

Methods: We performed a meta-analysis by searching PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for eligible studies. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to explore the association between miRs expression and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) on ovarian cancer patients. We also used Kaplan–Meier to analyze the relationship between miRs and OS in OncoLnc dataset. Results: A total of 15 records were included into the meta-analysis. The expression level of miR-200 family showed significant association with OS (HR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.64–0.94) and insignificant association with PFS (HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.50–1.03). Subgroup analysis revealed that an increased expression level of miR-200c was associated with better OS (HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.45–0.74). An increased expression level of miR-200a, miR-200c, and miR-141 was associated with better PFS (miR-200a, HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42–0.75; miR-200c, HR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.14–0.87, miR-141, HR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.12–0.63). Similarly, higher expression of miR-30 family was associated with elevated OS/PFS for ovarian cancer (OS, HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.13–0.74; PFS, HR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64–0.87). The OncoLnc dataset presented that elevated expression level of miR-30d-5p was associated with better OS (n = 470, P = .0197).

abstract = {Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Treatment with PARP inhibitors (PARPi), such as Olaparib, has been recently introduced for OC patients, but resistance may occur and underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. The aim of this study is to identify target genes within the tumor cells that might cause resistance to Olaparib. We focused on Neuropilin 1 (NRP1), a transmembrane receptor expressed in OC and correlated with poor survival, which has been also proposed as a key molecule in OC multidrug resistance. Methods: Using three OC cell lines (UWB, UWB-BRCA and SKOV3) as model systems, we evaluated the biological and molecular effects of Olaparib on OC cell growth, cell cycle, DNA damage and apoptosis/autophagy induction, through MTT and colony forming assays, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. We evaluated NRP1 expression in OC specimens and cell lines by Western blot and qRT-PCR, and used RNA interference to selectively inhibit NRP1. To identify miR-200c as a regulator of NRP1, we used miRNA target prediction algorithms and Pearsons' correlation analysis in biopsies from OC patients. Then, we used a stable transfection approach to overexpress miR-200c in Olaparib-resistant cells. Results: We observed that NRP1 is expressed at high levels in resistant cells (SKOV3) and is upmodulated in partially sensitive cells (UWB-BRCA) upon prolonged Olaparib treatment, leading to poor drug response. Our results show that the selective inhibition of NRP1 is able to overcome Olaparib resistance in SKOV3 cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that miR-200c can target NRP1 in OC cells, causing its downmodulation, and that miR-200c overexpression is a valid approach to restore Olaparib sensitivity in OC resistant cells. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that miR-200c significantly enhanced the anti-cancer efficacy of Olaparib in drug-resistant OC cells. Thus, the combination of Olaparib with miRNA-based therapy may represent a promising treatment for drug resistant OC, and our data may help in designing novel precision medicine trials for optimizing the clinical use of PARPi.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify the potential function of miRNA-96 in accelerating the malignant progression of ovarian cancer (OC) and its underlying mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression patterns of miRNA-96 in 36 matched OC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were determined by qRT-PCR. We analyzed the correlation between the miRNA-96 level and the clinical parameters of OC patients. Subsequently, the cellular levels of miRNA-96 in OC cell lines were determined as well. To construct miRNA-96 inhibitor and NC, the regulatory effects of miRNA-96 on the proliferative and migratory abilities in OC cells were examined. The target gene of miRNA-96 was verified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay. Finally, the rescue experiments were conducted to clarify the regulatory role of miRNA-96/FOXO3a axis in the malignant progression of OC. RESULTS: MiRNA-96 was upregulated in OC tissues relative to adjacent normal ones. Compared with OC patients presenting high-level of miRNA-96, those with low-level miRNA-96 suffered more advanced tumor staging and a worse overall survival. The transfection of miRNA-96 inhibitor markedly attenuated proliferative and migratory abilities in SKOV3 and CAOV3 cells. In addition, FOXO3a was identified to be the target gene of miRNA-96, which was negatively regulated by miRNA-96. FOXO3a exerted a lower abundance in OC tissues relative to adjacent normal ones. Finally, the rescue experiments revealed that FOXO3a knockdown could abolish the inhibitory role of miRNA-96 knockdown in the proliferative, migratory, and invasive abilities in OC cells. CONCLUSIONS: The knockdown of miRNA-96 attenuated the proliferative and migratory abilities in OC cells by targeting FOXO3a. We believed that miRNA-96 accelerates the malignant progression of OC, which could be utilized as a therapeutic target in clinical application.},

Results: Here, we first reported that expression levels of three genes, GJB2, S100A2 and SPOCK2, were significantly higher in advanced stage than that in early stage of ovarian cancer, and upregulation of them indicated poor prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer. Subsequently, 8, 6 and 20 miRNAs were predicted to target GJB2, S100A2 and SPOCK2, respectively. Among these miRNA-mRNA pairs, hsa-miR-363-3p-SPOCK2 axis was the most potential in suppressing progression of ovarian cancer. Mechanistically, we found that hsa-miR-363-3p-SPOCK2 axis was involved in regulation of actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, 6 pseudogenes and 8 lncRNAs were identified to potentially inhibit hsa-miR-363-3p-SPOCK2 axis in ovarian cancer. Conclusions: Collectively, we elucidate a regulatory role of pseudogene/lncRNA-hsa-miR-363-3p-SPOCK2 pathway in progression of ovarian cancer, which may provide effective therapeutic approaches and promising prognostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer. Materials and methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ovarian cancer were first screened using GSE12470, after which DEGs expression were validated using GEPIA. Kaplan-Meier analysis was employed to assess the prognostic values. Potential miRNAs were predicted by seven target prediction databases, and upstream lncRNAs and pseudogenes of hsa-miR-363-3p were forecasted through miRNet or starBase.

abstract = {Ovarian cancer is a gynecological cancer with high mortality and a heterogeneous nature which complicates its early detection and primary prevention. Numerous studies have evaluated expression profile microRNAs (miRNAs) in tissue and serum samples of ovarian cancer patients to find appropriate biomarkers for this malignancy. Functional experiments also verified the oncogenic or suppressor effects of a number of miRNAs. miRNAs exert their role through degradation or inhibition of translation of the target mRNA. Through this regulatory function, they modulate numerous cellular processes which are ultimately associated with carcinogenesis. A number of miRNAs including miR-135a-3p, miR-200c, miR-216a and miR-340 regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition program thus modulate invasiveness of ovarian cancer cell. Others have been shown to regulate some fundamental pathways in carcinogenesis such as mTOR and PI3K/AKT pathways. Such vast area of function of miRNAs in ovarian cancer has suggested them as putative therapeutic options for future years. In this review, we summarize the recent findings regarding the role of miRNAs in ovarian cancer pathogenesis, their application as biomarkers and the future perspectives of this research area.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the exact role of miR-663b in osteosarcoma (OS) progression and further explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The miR-663b expression in human OS cell lines was determined by qRT-PCR, and the results suggested that miR-663b was highly expressed in human OS cells. TargetScan was used to predict the potential targets of miR-663b, and the prediction was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. To investigate the role of miR-663b in OS, miR-663b was down-regulated in U2OS cells using miR-663b inhibitor. CCK8 and flow cytometry were preformed to investigate the proliferation and apoptosis of U2OS cells. Moreover, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were performed to measure the mRNA and protein expression. RESULTS: We found that miR-663b directly targets TP73 and negatively regulates TP73 expression. MiR-663b inhibitor significantly decreased the proliferation ability of U2OS cells, while the percentage of apoptotic cells was markedly increased. The level of Bcl-2 was notably inhibited by miR-663b inhibitor, while Bax expression was significantly enhanced. Moreover, miR-663b down-regulation promoted p53 and p21 expression in U2OS cells. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-663b down-regulation represses proliferation and induces apoptosis in OS by targeting TP73. Therefore, we provide a potential therapeutic target for OS treatment.},

Although overexpression of miR-663b in colorectal cancer was observed, the role of miR-663b in colorectal cancer cells has not been identified yet. In this study, we analyzed expression of miR-663b in colorectal tumors and explored the molecular mechanism of miR-663b in colorectal cancer cells. MiR-663b was significantly overexpressed in colorectal tumors and cell lines. Downregulation of miR-663b inhibited cell proliferation and sphere forming ability in colorectal cancer cells. In addition, miR-663b downregulation inactivated Ras/Raf signaling activity and subsequently decreased YAP1 and CD44 expression in colorectal cancer cells. Using TargetScan software, TNK1, a negative regulator of Ras/Raf signaling, was predicted to be a target gene of miR-663b. Western blotting and RT-qPCR showed that TNK1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-663b. In addition, the direct binding of miR-663b to TNK1 mRNA was proved by dual luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-663b inhibited colorectal cancer cell proliferation and stemness, which was reversed after siRNA-mediated silencing of TNK1. In conclusion, the current study revealed a pivotal role of miR-663b in the progression of colorectal cancer.},

Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as promising biomarkers that could lead to clinical applications. Here, to develop an optimal detection method, we use microarrays to obtain comprehensive miRNA profiles from 4046 serum samples, including 428 patients with ovarian tumors. A diagnostic model based on expression levels of ten miRNAs is constructed in the discovery set. Validation in an independent cohort reveals that the model is very accurate (sensitivity, 0.99; specificity, 1.00), and the diagnostic accuracy is maintained even in early-stage ovarian cancers. Furthermore, we construct two additional models, each using 9–10 serum miRNAs, aimed at discriminating ovarian cancers from the other types of solid tumors or benign ovarian tumors. Our findings provide robust evidence that the serum miRNA profile represents a promising diagnostic biomarker for ovarian cancer.},

The present study employed a multipronged approach to investigate the role of ERBB2 in cervical cancer. ERBB2 and microRNA (miR)‑3184‑5p expres‑ sion was assessed in patient‑derived cervical cancer biopsy tissues, revealing that higher levels of ERBB2 and lower levels of miR‑3184‑5p were associated with clinicopathological indi‑ cators of cervical cancer progression. Furthermore, ERBB2 stimulated proliferation, migration and sphere‑formation of cervical cancer cells in vitro. This effect was mediated by enhanced phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase catalytic subunit $\alpha$ activity. Additionally, it was revealed that miR‑3184‑5p directly suppressed ERBB2 in cervical cancer cells. The p53 activator Mithramycin A stimulated p53 and miR‑3184‑5p expression, thereby lowering the levels of ERBB2 and attenuating proliferation, migration and sphere‑formation of cervical cancer cells. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggested ERBB2 as an oncogenic protein that may promote invasiveness in cervical cancer cells. Treatment of cervical cancer cells with the p53 activator Mithramycin A restored the levels of the endogenous ERBB2 inhibitor miR‑3184‑5p and may represent a novel treatment strategy for cervical cancer.},

In humans, NKG2D is an activating immune receptor constitutively expressed in most cytotoxic lymphocytes including NK and CD8+ T cells. In this study, the expression of NKG2D molecule was investigated in peripheral blood NK cells from colorectal cancer patients and compared with healthy subjects. METHODS We studied 21 non-metastatic (low-grade), 17 non-metastatic (high-grade), 16 metastatic colorectal cancer patients, and 24 healthy controls. Peripheral blood samples were obtained to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the percentage of peripheral blood NKG2D+CD3-CD56+ NK cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of NKG2D at mRNA level was also measured by real-time PCR in both, patients and control subjects. RESULTS The results showed a significant reduction in the percentage of NKG2D+NK cells as well as NKG2D mRNA expression in peripheral blood of metastatic colon cancer patients. CONCLUSION This result suggests that decreased expression of activating NKG2D receptor in metastatic colorectal cancer might compromise NK cell function and allow tumor to evade immunity (Tab. 3, Fig. 4, Ref. 33).},

To better understand the role of miR-320a in ovarian cancer, we investigated miR-320a expression in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) specimens as well as EOC cell lines and analyzed correlations between miR-320a expression and processes associated with EOC progression. The miR-320a level in EOC specimens was found to be associated with ovarian cancer progression and infiltration. Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we found that miR-320a significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of EOC cells, and we identified RASSF8 as a target gene of miR-320a that was downregulated in EOC tissues and cell lines. In vitro downregulation of RASSF8 promoted the growth, migration, and invasion of EOC cells. Together these findings indicate that RASSF8 is a direct target of miR-320a, through which miR-320a promotes the progression of EOC.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the relative expression levels of miR-1275 in NSCLC tissues and cells. The correlations of miR-1275 expression with clinicopathological features of NSCLC were statistically analyzed. Clone formation assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay were used to detect the effects of interfering in miR-1275 expression on biological behaviors of NSCLC cells. Bioinformatics was used to predict the downstream target genes of miR-1275, and qRT-PCR and Western blotting were utilized for verification. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used to validate the binding of miR-1275 to its target gene. RESULTS: The results of qRT-PCR showed that among 70 cases of tissues from NSCLC patients, 52 cases had up-regulated miR-1275 expressions. MiR-1275 expression was increased in NSCLC cells compared with that in 16 human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Interfering in miR-1275 expression could inhibit the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of NSCLC cells. Bioinformatics prediction discovered that leucine zipper putative tumor suppressor 3 (LZTS3) might be a target gene of miR-1275. Dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that the two genes could bind directly. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-1275 is relatively highly expressed in NSCLC. Highly expressed miR- 1275 can promote the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC through regulating the expression of LZTS3.},

Let-7b and miR-143 have featured as tumor suppressors in ovarian cancer, which is in line with data on other types of cancer. Although two miRNAs, i.e. miR-26a-5p and miR-145-5p, act principally as tumor suppressor miRNAs, they occasionally exhibit oncogenic roles. The performance of miR-95-3p, upregulated in ascites, is open to debate given the current lack of supportive data on ovarian cancer; however, data on other cancers indicates its probable oncogenic role. Different findings have been reported for miR-182-5p and miR-200c-3p; in addition to their presumed oncogenic roles, contrasting findings have indicated their ambivalent functions.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical significance of microRNA-4429 (miR-4429) in the development and prognosis of ovarian cancer, and to explore the regulatory role of miR-4429 in migratory potential of ovarian cancer cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MiR-4429 levels in paired ovarian cancer species and paracancerous ones were examined. Then, the relationship between miR-4429 level and clinical features of ovarian cancer patients was analyzed. Potential influences of miR-4429 on migratory potentials in CAOV3 and SKOV3 cells were explored by transwell assay. After that, the interaction between miR-4429 and its downstream gene YOD1, and their involvement in the malignant development of ovarian cancer were finally demonstrated through Luciferase assay and rescue experiments. RESULTS: The results revealed that miR-4429 was downregulated in ovarian cancer tissues and cell lines. Its level was significantly correlated with rates of lymphatic metastasis (p=0.018) and distant metastasis (p=0.012) but not with age, tumor size, and tumor stage in ovarian cancer patients. Survival analysis uncovered that a low level of miR-4429 was unfavorable to PFS and OS in ovarian cancer patients. Besides, the overexpression of miR-4429 inhibited migratory potential in CAOV3 cells, and conversely, the knockdown of miR-4429 in SKOV3 cells obtained the opposite result. Moreover, YOD1 was proved to be the downstream gene binding to miR-4429. It was highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissues and negatively regulated by miR-4429. Rescue experiments finally identified that YOD1 was responsible for migratory potential changes in ovarian cancer cells regulated by miR-4429. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-4429 is downregulated in ovarian cancer tissues, and its level is closely linked to metastasis and prognosis in ovarian cancer patients.

The primary goal of the current study-consisting of patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer-was to identify the changes in circulating miRNA concentrations associated with decitabine followed by carboplatin chemotherapy treatment. A secondary goal was to associate clinical response with changes in circulating miRNA concentration. Methods We measured miRNA concentrations in plasma samples from 14 patients with platinumresistant, recurrent ovarian cancer enrolled in a phase II clinical trial that were treated with a low dose of the hypomethylating agent (HMA) decitabine for 5 days followed by carboplatin on day 8. The primary endpoint was to determine chemotherapy-associated changes in plasma miRNA concentrations. The secondary endpoint was to correlate miRNA changes with clinical response as measured by progression free survival (PFS). Results Seventy-eight miRNA plasma concentrations were measured at baseline (before treatment) and at the end of the first cycle of treatment (day 29). Of these, 10 miRNAs (miR-193a-5p, miR-375, miR-339-3p, miR-340-5p, miR-532-3p, miR-133a-3p, miR-25-3p, miR-10a-5p, miR-616-5p, and miR-148b-5p) displayed fold changes in concentration ranging from -2.9 to 4 (p<0.05), in recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients, that were associated with response to decitabine followed by carboplatin chemotherapy. Furthermore, lower concentrations of miR-148b-5p after this chemotherapy regimen were associated (P<0.05) with the PFS. Conclusions This is the first report demonstrating altered circulating miRNA concentrations following a combination platinum plus HMA chemotherapy regiment. In addition, circulating miR-148b-5p concentrations were associated with PFS and may represent a novel biomarker of therapeutic response, with this chemotherapy regimen, in women with recurrent, drug-resistant ovarian cancer.},

Previously, we determined that miR-34a expression was frequently reduced in high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the major subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Considering that the IL-6R/STAT3 signaling pathway is upregulated and believed to be a potential therapeutic target in EOC, we investigated the biological significance of reduced miR-34a expression in HGSC with regard to IL- 6R signaling. Additionally, we evaluated the viability of miR-34a as a therapeutic application for HGSC both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, we found that the ectopic expression of miR-34a significantly reduced tumor proliferation and invasion through downregulation of IL-6R expression, suggesting that reduced miR-34a expression might play an important role in the malignant potential of HGSC through upregulation of the IL-6R/STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that replacement of miR-34a reduced tumorigenicity of HGSC in vivo. Therefore, this study may provide the rationale for miR-34a replacement as a promising therapeutic strategy for HGSC.},

abstract = {Objectives The most widely used approach for the clinical management of women with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is surgery, followed by platinum and taxane based chemotherapy. The degree of macroscopic disease remaining at the conclusion of surgery is a key prognostic factor determining progression free and overall survival. We sought to develop a non-invasive test to assist surgeons to determine the likelihood of achieving complete surgical resection. This knowledge could be used to plan surgical approaches for optimal clinical management. Methods We profiled 170 serum microRNAs (miRNAs) using the Serum/Plasma Focus miRNA PCR panel containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) primers (Exiqon) in women with HGSOC (N = 56) and age-matched healthy volunteers (N = 30). Additionally, we measured serum CA-125 levels in the same samples. The HGSOC cohort was further classified based on the degree of macroscopic disease at the conclusion of surgery. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictive markers. Results We identified a combination of miR-375 and CA-125 as the strongest discriminator of healthy versus HGSOC serum, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.956. The inclusion of miR-210 increased the AUC to 0.984; however, miR-210 was affected by hemolysis. The combination of miR-34a-5p and CA-125 was the strongest predictor of completeness of surgical resection with an AUC of 0.818. Conclusion A molecular test incorporating circulating miRNA to predict completeness of surgical resection for women with HGSOC has the potential to contribute to planning for optimal patient management, ultimately improving patient outcome.},

abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Recently, several molecularly targeted anticancer agents have been developed for ovarian cancer; however, its prognosis remains extremely poor. The development of molecularly targeted therapy, as well as companion diagnostics, is required to improve outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer. In this study, to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the progression of ovarian cancer we analyzed serum miRNAs in patients with ovarian cancer using miRNA array and quantitative RT-PCR and examined the anticancer properties of miRNA expression in ovarian cancer cells. In patients with ovarian cancer, high amount of miR-135a-3p in serum samples was significantly associated with favorable clinical prognosis. The amount of miR-135a-3p was significantly decreased in patients with ovarian cancer compared with patients with ovarian cysts or normal ovaries. In SKOV-3 and ES-2 human ovarian cancer cells, enhanced expression of miR-135a-3p induced drug sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel and suppressed cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. These findings suggest that miR-135a-3p may be considered as a biomarker and a therapeutic agent in ovarian cancer.},

Many studies prove that forms of miR-135a, including miR-135a-5p and miR-135a-3p, serve as tumour suppressors in multiple cancers. Nevertheless, the precise function of miR-135a-3p and the molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of miR-135a-3p in ovarian carcinoma cell growth and metastasis remain largely unknown. Herein, we report that miR-135a-3p expression was significantly downregulated in ovarian carcinoma tissues compared with corresponding adjacent non-tumour tissues. Ectopic miR-135a-3p expression inhibited ovarian carcinoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. Additionally, the overexpression of miR-135a-3p inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian cancer cells. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed that the C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) gene was the target of miR-135a-3p. In addition, CCR2 depletion mimicked the inhibitory effects of miR-135a-3p on ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Rescue experiments using CCR2 overexpression further verified that CCR2 was a functional target of miR-135a-3p. Xenograft model assays demonstrated that miR-135a-3p functions as an anti-oncogene by targeting CCR2 in vivo. Taken together, these data prove that miR-135a-3p serves as a tumour suppressor gene in ovarian cancer by regulating CCR2.},

abstract = {Our recent studies of microRNA(miRNA) expression signatures indicated that microRNA-29a (miR-29a)was significantly downregulated in several types of human cancers, suggesting that miR-29a may be a putative tumor-suppressive miRNA in human cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of miR-29a incervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to identify novel miR-29a-regulated cancer pathways and target genes involved in cervical SCC oncogenesis and metastasis. Restoration of miR-29a in cervical cancer cell lines (CaSKi, HeLa, ME180 and Yumoto) revealed that this miRNA significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. Gene expression data and in silico analysis demonstrated that heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47), a member of the serpin superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors and a molecular chaperone involved in the maturation of collagen molecules, was a potential target ofmiR-29a regulation. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-29a directly regulated HSP47. Moreover, silencing of the HSP47 gene significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in cancer cells and the expression of HSP47 was upregulated in cancer tissues and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), as demonstrated by immunostaining. Downregulation of miR-29a was a frequent event in cervical SCC and miR-29a acted as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting HSP47. Recognition of tumor-suppressive miRNA-regulated molecular targets provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of cervical SCC oncogenesis and metastasis and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of this disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to detect the expression level of microRNA-584 (miRNA-584) in ovarian cancer (OCa) and to elucidate its regulatory effect on OCa progression by regulating LPIN1. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression levels of miRNA-584 and LPIN1 in 31 matched OCa tissues and paracancerous tissues were detected. The relationship of miRNA-584 level with clinical indicators and prognosis of OCa patients was analyzed. Influences of miRNA-584/LPIN1 regulatory loop on malignant phenotypes of OVCAR3 and PEO1 cells were assessed. In addition, the interaction between miRNA-584 and LPIN1 was confirmed by Dual-Luciferase reporter gene assay and rescue experiments. RESULTS: MiRNA-584 was lowly expressed in OCa tissues, while LPIN1 was highly expressed. OCa patients expressing a low level of miRNA-584 suffered from higher rates of lymphatic metastasis and distant metastasis, as well as worse survival. The overexpression of miRNA-584 in OVCAR3 cells attenuated proliferative and migratory abilities, while the knockdown of miRNA-584 in PEO1 cells yielded the opposite results. LPIN1 was verified to be the target binding to miRNA-584 and its level was negatively regulated by miRNA-584. The overexpression of LPIN1 accelerated OCa cells to proliferate and migrate. Importantly, LPIN1 was responsible for OCa progression regulated by miRNA-584. CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA-584 is downregulated in OCa tissues and cell lines. MiRNA-584 level is correlated with lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, and poor prognosis in OCa patients. By negatively regulating LPIN1, miRNA-584 suppresses the malignant progression of OCa.},

In many cases the effect of oncogenes and anti-oncogenes are mediated by various other molecules such as microRNAs. microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs established to post-transcriptionally regulate more than half of the protein coding genes. miR cluster 143/145 is one such cancer-related microRNA cluster which is down-regulated in most of the cancers and is able to hinder tumorigenesis by targeting tumor-associated genes. The fact that they could sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells by targeting multidrug resistant genes makes them potent tools to target cancer cells. Their low levels precede events which lead to cancer progression and therefore could be considered also as biomarkers to stage the disease. Interestingly, evidence suggests the existence of several in vivo mechanisms by which this cluster is differentially regulated at the molecular level to keep their levels low in cancer. In this review, we summarize the roles of miR cluster 143/145 in cancer, their potential prognostic applications and also their regulation during tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Introduction: MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNA molecules that are becoming popular biomarkers in several diseases. However, their low abun-dance in serum/plasma poses a challenge in exploiting their potential in clinics. Several commercial kits are available for rapid isolation of microRNA from plasma. However, reports guiding the selection of appropriate kits to study downstream assays are scarce. Hence, we compared four commercial kits to evaluate microRNA-extraction from plasma and provided a modified protocol that further improved the superior kit's performance. Materials and methods: We compared four kits (miRNeasy Serum/Plasma, miRNeasy Mini Kit from Qiagen; RNA-isolation, and Absolutely-RNA MicroRNA Kit from Agilent technologies) for quality and quantity of microRNA isolated, extraction efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Bioanalyzer-based Agilent Small RNA kit was used to evaluate quality and quantity of microRNA. Extraction efficiency was evaluated by detection of four endogenous control microRNA using real-time-PCR. Further, we modified the manufacturer's protocol for miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit to improve yield. Results: miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit outperformed the other three kits in microRNA-quality (P < 0.005) and yielded maximum microRNA-quan-tity. Recovery of endogenous control microRNA i.e. hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-191-5p, hsa-miR-423-5p and hsa-miR-484 was higher as well. Modifi-cation with the inclusion of a double elution step enhanced yield of microRNA extracted with miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit significantly (P < 0.001). Conclusion: We demonstrated that miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit outperforms other kits and can be reliably used with a limited plasma quantity.

abstract = {Background: Alterations of mTOR gene expression have been implicated in the pathogenesis of endometrioid endometrial cancer however only few studies explored the cause of increased mTOR activation in this malignancy. miRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs, which were proven to regulated gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. The study aimed to explore deregulation of miRNAs targeting mTOR kinase (miR-99a, miR-100 and miR-199b) as a possible cause of its altered expression in EEC tissues. In addition expression of the three miRNAs was investigated in plasma of EEC patients and was assessed in terms of diagnostic and prognostic utility.Methods: We investigated expression of mTOR kinase transcripts in 46 fresh tissue samples. Expression of miR-99a, miR-100 and miR-199b was investigated in the same group of fresh samples, and in additional 58 FFPE sections as well as in 48 plasma samples using qPCR. Relative quantification was performed using experimentally validated endogenous controls.Results: mTOR kinase expression was increased in EEC tissues and was accompanied by decreased expression of all three miRNAs. Down-regulation of the investigated miRNAs was discovered in plasma of EEC patients and miRNA signatures classified EEC tissues (miR-99a/miR-100/miR-199b) and plasma (miR-99a/miR-199b) samples with higher accuracy in comparison to single miRNAs. We also revealed that miR-100 was an independent prognostic marker of overall survival.Conclusions: We conclude that increased expression of mTOR kinase coexists with down-regulation of its targeting miRNAs, which could suggest a new mechanism of mTOR pathway alterations in EEC. In addition, our findings implicate that miRNA signatures can be considered promising biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma. {\textcopyright} 2012 Torres et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Human biological specimens are important for translational research programs such as the Canadian Ovarian Experimental Unified Resource (COEUR) funded by the Terry Fox Research Institute. Sample quality is an important consideration, as it directly impacts the quality of ensuing research. The aim of the present study was to determine the quality of tissues collected from different sites contributing to the COEUR cohort. Samples from high-grade serous ovarian tumors (fresh frozen and corresponding paraffin-embedded tissues) were provided by nine participating Canadian biobanks. All samples were shipped to a central site using a Standard Operating Protocol (SOP). DNA and RNA extraction was conducted by the quality control division of the Canadian Tumor Repository Network (CTRNet). DNA quality was determined by {\ss}-globin gene PCR amplification, and RNA quality by the RNA integrity number (RIN), as measured by the Agilent BioAnalyzer. DNA of acceptable quality had at least three bands of {\ss}-globin amplified from DNA (n = 115/135), and a RIN number ‡ 7 was considered very good for RNA (n = 80/135). Sample preparation and storage time had little effect on RNA or DNA quality. Protein expression was assessed on tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against p53, WT1, E-cadherin, CK-7, and Ki67 from formalin fixed-paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. As seen with a nonhierarchical clustering statistical method, there was no significant difference in immunostaining of paraffin tissues among specimens from different biobanks. Interestingly, patients with worse outcome were highly positive for p53 and weak for WT1. In conclusion, while there was no common SOP for retrospectively collected material across Canadian biobanks, these results indicate that specimens collected at these multiple sites are of comparable quality, and can serve as an adequate resource to create a national cohort for the validation of molecular biomarkers in ovarian cancer. {\textcopyright} 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {In clinical practice, patients' tissues are fixed and paraffin-embedded in order to enable histological diagnosis. Nowadays, those tissues are also used for molecular characterization. Formalin is the most used fixative worldwide, and Bouin's solution in some worldwide institutions. Among molecular targets, micro RNAs (miRNAs), the single-stranded non-coding RNAs comprised of 18 to 24 nucleotides, have been demonstrated to be resistant to fixation and paraffin-embedding processes, with consequent possible application in clinical practice. In the present study, let-7e-5p, miR-423-3p, miR-92a-1-5p, miR-30d-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-200a-3p, and miR-429 were investigated in formalin and matched Bouin's solution-fixed tissues of high grade serous ovarian cancers by means of real-time and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Micro RNAs were detectable and analyzable in both formalin- and Bouin's-fixed specimens, but on average, higher Ct values and lower copies/µL were found in Bouin's-fixed samples. Data from formalin-fixed samples correlated significantly for most targets with Bouin's ones, except for let-7e-5p and miR-155-5p. This study shows that miRNAs are analyzable in both formalin- and Bouin's-fixed specimens, with the possibility, after proper data normalization, to compare miRNA-based data from formalin-fixed samples to those of Bouin's-fixed ones.},

abstract = {Histopathology archives of well-annotated formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens are valuable resources for retrospective studies of human diseases. Since recovery of quality intact mRNA compatible with molecular techniques is often difficult due to degradation, we evaluated microRNA (miRNA), a novel class of small RNA molecules with growing therapeutic and diagnostic potential, as an alternative analyte for gene expression studies of FFPE samples. Analyzing total RNA yield, miRNA recovery, and robustness of real-time polymerase chain reaction for miRNA, mRNA, and rRNA species, we compared the performance of commercially available RNA isolation kits and identified a preferred methodology. We further implemented modifications to increase tissue throughput and incorporate a quantitative Armored RNA process control to monitor RNA recovery efficiency. The optimized process was tested for reproducibility as well as interoperator and interday variability, and was validated with a set of 30 clinical samples. In addition, we demonstrated that, independent of FFPE block age and RNA quality, miRNAs generate quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction signals that are more robust and better correlate with expression levels from frozen reference samples compared with longer mRNAs. Our broad study, including a total of 272 independent RNA isolations from 17 tissue types and 65 FFPE blocks up to 12 years old, indicates that miRNAs are not only suitable but are also likely superior analytes for the molecular characterization of compromised archived clinical specimens.

abstract = {MicroRNAs are considered as promising prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers of human cancer since their profiles differ between tumor types. Most of the tumor profiling studies were performed on rarely available fresh frozen (FF) samples. Alternatively, archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples are also well applicable to larger-scale retrospective miRNA profiling studies. The aim of this study was to perform systematic comparison of the miRNA expression profiles between FF and macrodissected FFPE tonsillar tumors using the TaqMan Low Density Array system, with the data processed by different software programs and two types of normalization methods. We observed a marked correlation between the miRNA expression profiles of paired FF and FFPE samples; however, only 27-38% of the differentially deregulated miRNAs overlapped between the two source systems. The comparison of the results with regard to the distinct modes of data normalization revealed an overlap in 58-67% of differentially expressed miRNAs, with no influence of the choice of software platform. Our study highlights the fact that for an accurate comparison of the miRNA expression profiles from published studies, it is important to use the same type of clinical material and to test and select the best-performing normalization method for data analysis.},

Cell-free, circulating microRNAs have the potential as diagnostic biomarkers in cancer. Here, we performed and validated a miRNA panel with the potential to distinguish OC from benign pelvic masses. Methods The profile of plasma microRNA was determined with a panel of 46 candidates in a discovery group and a validation group, each consisting of 190 pre-surgery plasma samples from age-matched patients with malignant (n = 95) and benign pelvic mass (n = 95), by real time RT-qPCR. Results Four up-regulated (miR-200c-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-21-5p, and miR-484) and two down-regulated (miR-195-5p and miR-451a) microRNAs were discovered. From those, miR-200c-3p and miR-221-3p were further confirmed in a validation cohort. A combination of these 2 microRNAs together with CA-125 yielded an overall diagnostic accuracy of AUC = 0.96. Conclusions We showed consistent plasma microRNA profiles that provide independent diagnostic information of late stage OC.},

abstract = {Background Risk of relapse or progression remains high in the treatment of most patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, and development of a molecular predictor could be a valuable tool for stratification of patients by risk. We aimed to develop a microRNA (miRNA)-based molecular classifier that can predict risk of progression or relapse in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods We analysed miRNA expression profiles in three cohorts of samples collected at diagnosis. We used 179 samples from a Multicenter Italian Trial in Ovarian cancer trial (cohort OC179) to develop the model and 263 samples from two cancer centres (cohort OC263) and 452 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas epithelial ovarian cancer series (cohort OC452) to validate the model. The primary clinical endpoint was progression-free survival, and we adapted a semi-supervised prediction method to the miRNA expression profile of OC179 to identify miRNAs that predict risk of progression. We assessed the independent prognostic role of the model using multivariable analysis with a Cox regression model. Findings We identified 35 miRNAs that predicted risk of progression or relapse and used them to create a prognostic model, the 35-miRNA-based predictor of Risk of Ovarian Cancer Relapse or progression (MiROvaR). MiROvaR was able to classify patients in OC179 into a high-risk group (89 patients; median progression-free survival 18 months [95% CI 15–22]) and a low-risk group (90 patients; median progression-free survival 38 months [24–not estimable]; hazard ratio [HR] 1{\textperiodcentered}85 [1{\textperiodcentered}29–2{\textperiodcentered}64], p=0{\textperiodcentered}00082). MiROvaR was a significant predictor of progression in the two validation sets (OC263 HR 3{\textperiodcentered}16, 95% CI 2{\textperiodcentered}33–4{\textperiodcentered}29, p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001; OC452 HR 1{\textperiodcentered}39, 95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}11–1{\textperiodcentered}74, p=0{\textperiodcentered}0047) and maintained its independent prognostic effect when adjusted for relevant clinical covariates using multivariable analyses (OC179: adjusted HR 1{\textperiodcentered}48, 95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}03–2{\textperiodcentered}13, p=0{\textperiodcentered}036; OC263: adjusted HR 3{\textperiodcentered}09 [2{\textperiodcentered}24–4{\textperiodcentered}28], p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001; and OC452: HR 1{\textperiodcentered}41 [1{\textperiodcentered}11–1{\textperiodcentered}79], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0047). Interpretation MiROvaR is a potential predictor of epithelial ovarian cancer progression and has prognostic value independent of relevant clinical covariates.

However, relatively few models are externally validated and validation by independent researchers is rare. External validation is necessary to determine a prediction model's reproducibility and generalizability to new and different patients. Various methodological considerations are important when assessing or designing an external validation study. In this article, an overview is provided of these considerations, starting with what external validation is, what types of external validation can be distinguished and why such studies are a crucial step towards the clinical implementation of accurate prediction models. Statistical analyses and interpretation of external validation results are reviewed in an intuitive manner and considerations for selecting an appropriate existing prediction model and external validation population are discussed.

The reported issues with miRNA isolation using traditional RNA reagents necessitates the optimisation of miRNA isolation from challenging samples. In this study we compared six commercial RNA extraction kits to evaluate their ability to isolate miRNA from ovine plasma. We also compared three methods for quantification of small RNA extracted from plasma to determine the most reliable. Using minimal sample inputs of fresh and frozen plasma from five sheep, we compared the six kits (Kit A-F) using quantitative PCR. Operational factors were also assessed for each kit. Kits A and B provided the best detection of the miRNA qPCR reference genes across fresh and frozen samples (p < 0.001) followed by Kit C. The Qubit and microRNA assay provided the least variation (% CV 5.47, SEM ± 0.07), followed by the NanoDrop (% CV 7.01, SEM ± 0.92) and Agilent Bioanalyzer (% CV 59.21, SEM ± 1.31). We identify Kit A to be optimal for isolating miRNA from small volumes of fresh and frozen ovine plasma, and Kit B the top performing kit taking into consideration miRNA detection and operational factors.

abstract = {Background: Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been found in human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). However, the role and mechanism of action of miR-23a in EOC remain unclear. Methods: The roles of miR-23a, IKK$\alpha$, and ST7L in EOC were determined by MTT, colony formation, wounding healing, transwell, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, and western blotting experiments. miR-23a target genes were validated by EGFP reporter assays, RT-qPCR, and western blotting analysis. Results: miR-23a is upregulated and promotes tumorigenic activity by facilitating the progress of cell cycle and EMT and repressing apoptosis in EOC cells. miR-23a enhances the expression of IKK$\alpha$ but suppresses the expression of ST7L by binding the 3′UTR of each transcript in EOC cells. The proliferation, migration, and invasion of EOC cells are increased by IKK$\alpha$ and inhibited by ST7L. Furthermore, miR-23a activates NF-$\kappa$B by upregulating IKK$\alpha$ and WNT/MAPK pathway by downregulating ST7L. Conclusions: miR-23a functions as an oncogene by targeting IKK$\alpha$ and ST7L, thus contributing to the malignancy of EOC cells.},

abstract = {The importance of high quality sample material, i.e. non-degraded or fragmented RNA, for classical gene expression profiling is well documented. Hence, the analysis of RNA quality is a valuable tool in the preparation of methods like RT-qPCR and microarray analysis. For verification of RNA integrity, today the use of automated capillary electrophoresis is state of the art. Following the recently published MIQE guidelines, these pre-PCR evaluations have to be clearly documented in scientific publication to increase experimental transparency. RNA quality control may also be integrated in the routine analysis of new applications like the investigation of microRNA (miRNA) expression, as there is little known yet about factors compromising the miRNA analysis. Agilent Technologies is offering a new lab-on-chip application for the 2100 Bioanalyzer making it possible to quantify miRNA in absolute amounts [pg] and as a percentage of small RNA [%]. Recent results showed that this analysis method is strongly influenced by total RNA integrity. Ongoing RNA degradation is accompanied by the formation of small RNA fragments leading to an overestimation of miRNA amount on the chip. Total RNA integrity is known to affect the performance of RT-qPCR as well as the quantitative results in mRNA expression profiling. The actual study identified a comparable effect for miRNA gene expression profiling. Using a suitable normalization method could partly reduce the impairing effect of total RNA integrity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression by binding to target mRNAs. miRNAs have not been comprehensively studied in recurrent ovarian cancer, yet an incurable disease. Results: Using real-time RT-PCR, we obtained distinct miRNA expression profiles between primary and recurrent serous papillary ovarian adenocarcinomas (n = 6) in a subset of samples previously used in a transcriptome approach. Expression levels of top dysregulated miRNA genes, miR-223 and miR-9, were examined using TaqMan PCR in independent cohorts of fresh frozen (n = 18) and FFPE serous ovarian tumours (n = 22). Concordance was observed on TaqMan analysis for miR-223 and miR-9 between the training cohort and the independent test cohorts. Target prediction analysis for the above miRNA "recurrent metastatic signature" identified genes previously validated in our transcriptome study. Common biological pathways well characterised in ovarian cancer were shared by miR-9 and miR-223 lists of predicted target genes. We provide strong evidence that miR-9 acts as a putative tumour suppressor gene in recurrent ovarian cancer. Components of the miRNA processing machinery, such as Dicer and Drosha are not responsible for miRNA deregulation in recurrent ovarian cancer, as deluded by TaqMan and immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: We propose a miRNA model for the molecular pathogenesis of recurrent ovarian cancer.

abstract = {Ovarian cancer is one of the leading malignancies in women and the 5-year survival rate of ovarian cancer still remains poor. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the interaction between the miR-126-3p and PLXNB2 in the progression of ovarian cancer. The qRT-PCR data revealed a reduction of miR-126-3p level in ovarian cancer tissues comparing to the adjacent normal tissues. Over-expression of miR-126-3p in ovarian cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation and invasion and the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. The cell cycle assay results showed that the over-expression of miR-126-3p induced cells in G1-phase and reduced cells in S-phase. We further performed bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay to investigate the relationship between miR-126-3p and PLXNB2 in ovarian cancer cells. The results of TargetScan suggested that PLXNB2 is a direct target of miR-126-3p in ovarian cancer cells, and luciferase assay confirmed bioinformatics prediction. Knocking down of PLXNB2 with PLXNB2 siRNA results in repressed ovarian cancer cell proliferation and invasion, and decreased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2, which is similar to the effect of over-expression of miR-126-3p in OC cells. The synergistic effect of combination of miR-126-3p over-expression and PLXNB2 down-regulation on the cell growth viability, cell colony, and cell invasion was also identified. All these findings indicated that miR-126-3p is involved in the progression of ovarian cancer via direct regulating PLXNB2.},

abstract = {Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most common tumors in females. Growing evidence shows that microRNA-506-3p (miR-506-3p) is downregulated in OC tissues. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of miR-506-3p in modulating OC. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to investigate the expression of miR-506-3p and its target in OC tissues or cell lines. CCK-8 or colony formation assay was used to examine cell viability or proliferation, respectively. Flow cytometry was demonstrated to detect cell apoptosis. Western blot was then applied to analyze underlying mechanisms. The potential target of miR-506-3p was examined via luciferase reporter assay. MiR-506-3p was significantly downregulated in both human OC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-506-3p not only decreased cell viability of OC cell lines but also promoted cell apoptosis, thus inhibiting OC progression. Moreover, SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) was found to be a direct target of miR-506-3p, and SIRT1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-506-3p in OC cell lines. Further investigation revealed that overexpression of SIRT1 could promote cell viability as well as inhibit cell apoptosis, showing the reversed effect on OC progression compared to miR-506-3p. Lastly, AKT (Protein kinase B) /FOXO3a (Forkhead box O3) signaling pathway was inactivated by miR-506-3p while activated by SIRT1, relating to regulation of miR-506-3p on OC progression. Our results revealed a novel mechanism by which miR-506-3p inhibited proliferation while promoted apoptosis of OC via inactivation of SIRT1/AKT/FOXO3a signaling pathway, suggesting that miR-506-3p might be a potential target for OC.},

abstract = {Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is an intractable gynecological malignancy due to the high recurrence rate. Several molecular biomarkers have been previously screened for early identifying patients with a high recurrence risk and poor prognosis. However, all the known studies focused on a single type of RNAs, not integrating various types. This study was to construct a new multi-RNA-based model to predict the recurrence and prognosis for OvCa patients by using the messenger RNA (mRNA, including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)) and microRNA (miRNA) sequencing data of The Cancer Genome Atlas database. After univariate Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analyses, a multi-RNA-based signature (2 miRNAs: hsa-miR-508, hsa-miR-506; 1 lncRNA: TM4SF1-AS1; 11 mRNAs: MAGI3, SLAMF7, GLI2, PDK1, ARID3A, PLEKHG4B, TNFAIP8L3, C1QTNF3, NDUFAF1, CH25H, TMEM129) was generated and used to establish a risk score model. The high- and low-risk patients classified by the median risk score exhibited significantly different recurrence risks (89% versus 61%, p<0.001) and survival time (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.901 for 5-year disease-free survival (DFS)). This risk model was independent of other clinical features and superior to pathologic staging for DFS prediction (AUC, 0.906 versus 0.524; C-index, 0.633 versus 0.510). Furthermore, some new interaction axes were revealed to explain the possible functions of these RNAs (competing endogenous RNA: TM4SF1-AS1-miR-186-STEAP2, LINC00536-miR-508-STEAP2, LINC00475-miR-506-TMEM129; coexpression: LINC00598-PLEKHG4B). In conclusion, this multi-RNA-based risk model may be clinically useful to stratify OvCa patients with different recurrence risks and survival outcomes and included RNAs may be potential therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the down-regulation effect of let-7b-5p on the expression of FTO in acute myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1 and inhibitory effect on THP-1 proliferation via m6A/MYC signaling pathway. METHODS: The acute myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1 and the normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were selected as subjects. The expression of let-7b-5p and FTO mRNA in those cells was detected by qPCR, further the expression of FTO protein in those cells was detected by Western blot. And, the luciferase reporter gene assay was used to verify the targeting effect of let-7b-5p on FTO. Finally, THP-1 cells were transfected respectively with let-7b-5p mimic, and PBMNC with let-7b-5p inhibitor, there after the C-MYC mRNA m6A enrichment level in transfected cells was analyzed by dot blot, the expression levels of let-7b-5p, FTO and c-MYC were assayed by RT-PCR, the expressions of FTO and c-MYC protein were verified by Western blot, and the proliferation level of cells after transfection was detected by MTT assay. RESULTS: Compared with PBMNC, the expression of let-7b-5p in THP-1 significantly decreased, while the expression of FTO was significantly increased (P<0.05). After transfection with let-7b-5p mimic combined with FTO 3'-UTR, the luciferase activity of transfected THP-1 cells significantly decreased, but the luciferase activity significantly increased after transfection with mutant 3'-UTR, which was significantly different from the negative control group(blank vector) (P<0.05). Let-7b-5p inhibitor down-regulated c-MYC mRNA m6A enrichment, and then up-regulated the expression of FTO in transfected PBMNC cells, the effects of which were significant (P<0.05). However, let-7b-5p mimic up-regulated c-MYC mRNA m6A enrichment level and down-regulated the expression of FTO in the transfected THP-1 cells, and the cell proliferation rate was significantly lower than that in the negative control group (blank vector) (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Human acute myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1 low expresses the let-7b-5p, which regulates c-MYC expression through let-7b-5p-/FTO-/m6A axis and promotes the proliferation of leukemia cell line THP-1.},

The study also explored the correlation of miR-23a and miR-23b expression levels in the tumor tissues with the clinic-pathological parameters and prognosis of the patients. Specimens of frozen tumor tissues and normal tissues adjacent to the tumor were collected from 50 patients with ovarian cancer. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was adopted to detect the expression levels of miR-23a and miR-23b in tumor tissues. Furthermore, normal tissues adjacent to the tumor were utilized as the control for the experiments and Pearson method was used to analyze the correlation between miR-23a and miR-23b expression levels in tumor tissues. The correlation of miR-23a and miR-23 expression in tumor tissues and the prognosis of the patients with ovarian cancer was analyzed in combination with clinical data. The expression of miR-23a in the tissues of ovarian cancer was significantly higher in comparison with normal adjacent tissues. However, the expression of miR-23b in the tissues of ovarian cancer was significantly lower when compared with adjacent normal tissues. Notably, the expression of miR-23a was negatively correlated with that of miR-23b in tumor tissues of ovarian cancer. The high expression of miR-23a and the low expression of miR-23b in tumor tissues of the patients was correlated with the degree of tumor differentiation, metastasis of lymph nodes and clinical staging. The five-year overall survival rate of the patients was 36% (18/50). Univariate survival analysis indicated that miR-23a and miR-23b were the factors influencing the overall survival rate of ovarian cancer. The present findings suggest that high expression of miR-23a and the low expression of miR-23b are closely correlated with the occurrence and development of ovarian cancer. The abnormal expression of the miR-23a and miR-23b could be utilized as potential prognostic molecular markers of ovarian cancer.},

Also, miR-223 expression has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer in comparison with normal tissue. However, whether miR-223 displays different expression in ovarian cancer and what its underlying functions are in ovarian cancer have remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-223-3p was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissue. Next, we explored the functional role of miR-223-3p in ovarian cancer using SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cell lines. Our results suggested that miR-223-3p mimic promoted ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. However, miR-223-3p inhibitor displayed the opposite effects. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-223-3p mimic promoted tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, we found SOX11 (sex determining region Y-box 11) was inversely expressed with miR-223-3p in ovarian cancer (OC) cell lines and tissue specimens. miR-223-3p mimic decreased SOX11 expression. Overexpressing SOX11 inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and invasion, which indicated that miR-223-3p regulated OC cell proliferation and invasion through targeting SOX11 expression. In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrated that miR-223-3p could be a potential therapeutic for ovarian cancer.},

We previously reported that human sEVs from bone marrow (BM)-CD34+ cells and pericardial fluid (PF) are proangiogenic. Here, we have shown that sEVs secreted from saphenous vein pericytes and BM mesenchymal stem cells also promote angiogenesis. Analysis of miRNA datasets available in-house or datamined from GEO identified the let-7 family as common miRNA signature of the proangiogenic sEVs. LNPs with either hsa-let-7b-5p or cyanine 5 (Cy5)-conjugated Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39 (Cy5-cel-miR-39; control miRNA) were prepared using microfluidic micromixing. let-7b-5p-AEs did not cause toxicity and transferred functionally active let-7b-5p to recipient endothelial cells (ECs). let-7b-AEs also improved EC survival under hypoxia and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

abstract = {Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women worldwide and has the highest mortality amongst gynecological cancers. miRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs, approximately 22 nt long, that negatively regulate gene expression and have roles in cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Dysregulated miRNA-223 expression has been implicated in a wide range of cancer subtypes. SMARCD1 is an integral protein component of the SWI/SNF complex, which remodels chromatin, and which has important roles in transcriptional control, DNA replication, recombination and repair. In this study, we examined whether the expression levels of miR-223 and SMARCD1 are altered in ovarian serous neoplasia and whether miR-223 functionally regulates the gene and protein expression of SMARCD1 in vivo, as has been predicted by in silico methods. Benign, atypical proliferative serous tumors (borderline) and malignant serous tumors (n = 144) were laser-capture microdissected, and relative expression levels of miR-223 and SMARCD1 were quantified by RT-PCR. Ovarian cancer cell line OC316 was reverse transfected with a miR-223 mimic, and relative expression levels of miR-223 and SMARCD1 were quantified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction; protein expression of SMARCD1 was evaluated by Western blot. miR-223 expression was up-regulated in high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma samples (median RQ = 4.8881, P =.0045), whilst SMARCD1 was down-regulated (median RQ = 0.5107, P =.0492). In OC316 cells transfected with a miR-223 mimic, SMARCD1 gene expression was down-regulated 3-fold (P =.001), and SMARCD1 protein expression was down-regulated 2-fold (P =.002). These results suggest a regulatory role for miR-223 in ovarian serous neoplasia, linking it with SMARCD1.},

In this study, we aimed to (1) identify the miRNAs responsible for sEV-induced angiogenesis; (2) develop the prototype of bioinspired “artificial exosomes” (AEs) combining LNPs with a proangiogenic miRNA, and (3) validate the angiogenic potential of the bioinspired AEs. We previously reported that human sEVs from bone marrow (BM)-CD34+ cells and pericardial fluid (PF) are proangiogenic. Here, we have shown that sEVs secreted from saphenous vein pericytes and BM mesenchymal stem cells also promote angiogenesis. Analysis of miRNA datasets available in-house or datamined from GEO identified the let-7 family as common miRNA signature of the proangiogenic sEVs. LNPs with either hsa-let-7b-5p or cyanine 5 (Cy5)-conjugated Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39 (Cy5-cel-miR-39; control miRNA) were prepared using microfluidic micromixing. let-7b-5p-AEs did not cause toxicity and transferred functionally active let-7b-5p to recipient endothelial cells (ECs). let-7b-AEs also improved EC survival under hypoxia and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Bioinspired proangiogenic AEs could be further developed into innovative nanomedicine products targeting ischemic diseases.},

abstract = {Typical and atypical carcinoid tumors belong to the neuroendocrine lung tumors. They have low recurrence and proliferation rate, lymph node, and distant metastases. Nevertheless, these tumors have shown a more aggressive behavior. In the last years, microRNAs were screened as new tumor markers for their potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. The expression of hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-miR-222-3p, and their targets HMGA2 (high-mobility group A2) and CDKN1B (cyclin-dependent kynase inhibitor 1B, p27kip1) was evaluated in this rare small group of patients. We analyzed the clinical data of all typical and atypical carcinoid tumors of patients who underwent surgical operation at Marburg University Hospital (n = 18) from 2000. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue versus four tumor-free lung tissue samples. HMGA2 was stable or downregulated; only one patient showed a significant overexpression. CDKN1B showed a significant overexpression or a stable level; it was downregulated in two samples only. Hsa-miR-222-3p resulted almost stable or overexpressed except for two samples (significantly downregulated). Hsa-let-7f-5p was stable or overexpressed in the majority of analyzed samples, whereas hsa-let-7b-5p was significantly downregulated. HMGA2 and CDKN1B are differently expressed between atypical and typical carcinoid tumors, thus representing valid biomarkers for the classification of the two tumor groups. Hsa-let-7f-5p and HMGA2 are inversely correlated. Hsa-miR-222-3p does not correlate with its predicted target CDKN1B.},

abstract = {Objectives: Ovarian cancer is one of the most fatal gynecologic malignities. miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, and miR-638 genes were found to have been associated with ovarian cancer in accordance with the data obtained from the previous microarray research performed by Tuncer et al. (J Ovarian Res 13(1):99, 2020). The expression levels of these miRNAs in the peripheral blood samples of 142 ovarian cancer patients, and 97 healthy controls were investigated for performing the validation, and to identify whether these genes were the possible biomarkers to be used in the early diagnosis of high-risk ovarian cancer patients, and in the prognosis of patients. Methods: The miRNA expression analysis was performed using the miRNA-specific cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR methods following the RNA isolation from the peripheral blood lymphocytes. Results: miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, and miR-638 miRNA gene expression levels were found to have twofold higher expression levels in patient groups compared with the gene expression levels in healthy controls, and were statistically significant (p < 0.05). In addition, the comparison of the miRNA expression levels with the clinical data of patients showed that there was a significant difference with smoking history and the increased expression level of miR-17-5 (p: 0.007). There was a significant difference between the increased expression level of miR-638 with the locally advanced stage, and abdominal/pelvic metastatic patients (p: 0.03). Conclusions: The obtained data suggest that miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, and miR-638 molecules might be the noninvasive biomarkers in identifying the ovarian cancer. However, the investigation and monitoring of the changeability of these biomarkers in benign ovarian diseases, and during the treatment must be performed in future studies for identifying the accurate diagnostic, and prognostic features of miRNAs.},

abstract = {Background: Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer with high mortality rate and generally diagnosed in advanced stages. The 5-year disease-free survival is below 40%. MicroRNAs, subset of the non-coding RNA molecules, regulate the translation in post transcriptional level by binding to specific mRNAs to promote or degrade the target oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Abnormal expression of miRNAs were found in numerous human cancer, including ovarian cancer. Investigating the miRNAs derived from the peripheral blood samples can be used as a marker in the diagnose, treatment and prognosis of ovarian cancer. We aimed to find biological markers for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer by investigating BRCA1 gene mutation carrier monozygotic discordant twins and their high risk healthy family individual's miRNAs. Methods: The study was conducted on monozygotic twins discordant for ovarian cancer, and the liquid biopsy exploration of miRNAs was performed on mononuclear cells that were isolated from the peripheral blood samples. The miRNA expression profile changes in the study were found by using microarray analysis. miRNA isolation procedure performed from the lymphocyte in accordance with the kit protocol. The presence and quality of the isolated miRNAs screened by electrophoresis. Raw data logarithmic analysis was studied by identifying the threshold, normalization, correlation, mean and median values. Target proteins were detected for each miRNA by using different algorithms. Results: After the comparison of monozygotic discordant twins for epithelial ovarian carcinoma upregulation of the 4 miRNAs, miR-6131, miR-1305, miR-197-3p, miR-3651 and downregulation of 4 miRNAs, miR-3135b, miR-4430, miR-664b-5p, miR-766-3p were found statically significant. Conclusions: The detected 99 miRNAs out of 2549 miRNAs might be used in the clinic as new biological indicators in the diagnosis and follow up of epithelial ovarian cancer with complementary studies. The miRNA expression profiles were identified to be statistically significant in the evaluation of ovarian cancer etiology, BRCA1 mutation status, and ovarian cancer risk in accordance with the obtained data. There is a need for validation of the miRNAs which were particularly detected between monozygotic twins and its association with ovarian cancer was emphasized in our study in wider cohorts including ovarian cancer patients, and healthy individuals.},

abstract = {Background: Gene expression analysis is an essential part of biological and medical investigations. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is characterized with excellent sensitivity, dynamic range, reproducibility and is still regarded to be the gold standard for quantifying transcripts abundance. Parallelization of qPCR such as by microfluidic Taqman Fluidigm Biomark Platform enables evaluation of multiple transcripts in samples treated under various conditions. Despite advanced technologies, correct evaluation of the measurements remains challenging. Most widely used methods for evaluating or calculating gene expression data include geNorm and $\Delta$$\Delta$Ct, respectively. They rely on one or several stable reference genes (RGs) for normalization, thus potentially causing biased results. We therefore applied multivariable regression with a tailored error model to overcome the necessity of stable RGs. Results We developed a RG independent data normalization approach based on a tailored linear error model for parallel qPCR data, called LEMming. It uses the assumption that the mean Ct values within samples of similarly treated groups are equal. Performance of LEMming was evaluated in three data sets with different stability patterns of RGs and compared to the results of geNorm normalization. Data set 1 showed that both methods gave similar results if stable RGs are available. Data set 2 included RGs which are stable according to geNorm criteria, but became differentially expressed in normalized data evaluated by a t-test. geN-orm-normalized data showed an effect of a shifted mean per gene per condition whereas LEMming-normalized data did not. Comparing the decrease of standard deviation from raw data to geNorm and to LEMming, the latter was superior. In data set 3 according to geNorm calculated average expression stability and pairwise variation, stable RGs were available, but t-tests of raw data contradicted this. Normalization with RGs resulted in distorted data contradicting literature, while LEMming normalized data did not. Conclusions: If RGs are coexpressed but are not independent of the experimental conditions the stability criteria based on inter- and intragroup variation fail. The linear error model developed, LEMming, overcomes the dependency of using RGs for parallel qPCR measurements, besides resolving biases of both technical and biological nature in qPCR. However, to distinguish systematic errors per treated group from a global treatment effect an additional measurement is needed. Quantification of total cDNA content per sample helps to identify systematic errors.},

Defective HR is an important therapeutic target in EOC as exemplified by the efficacy of platinum analogues in this disease, as well as the advent of PARP inhibitors, which exhibit synthetic lethality when applied to HR-deficient cells. Here, we describe the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of HR-deficient EOCs, discuss current and emerging approaches for targeting these tumors, and present challenges associated with these approaches, focusing on development and overcoming resistance. Significance: Defective DNA repair via HR is a pivotal vulnerability of EOC, particularly of the highgrade serous histologic subtype. Targeting defective HR offers the unique opportunity of exploiting molecular differences between tumor and normal cells, thereby inducing cancer-specific synthetic lethality; the promise and challenges of these approaches in ovarian cancer are discussed in this review.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that play important roles in regulating gene expression. The majority of miRNAs are transcribed from DNA sequences into primary miRNAs and processed into precursor miRNAs, and finally mature miRNAs. In most cases, miRNAs interact with the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of target mRNAs to induce mRNA degradation and translational repression. However, interaction of miRNAs with other regions, including the 5' UTR, coding sequence, and gene promoters, have also been reported. Under certain conditions, miRNAs can also activate translation or regulate transcription. The interaction of miRNAs with their target genes is dynamic and dependent on many factors, such as subcellular location of miRNAs, the abundancy of miRNAs and target mRNAs, and the affinity of miRNA-mRNA interactions. miRNAs can be secreted into extracellular fluids and transported to target cells via vesicles, such as exosomes, or by binding to proteins, including Argonautes. Extracellular miRNAs function as chemical messengers to mediate cell-cell communication. In this review, we provide an update on canonical and non-canonical miRNA biogenesis pathways and various mechanisms underlying miRNA-mediated gene regulations. We also summarize the current knowledge of the dynamics of miRNA action and of the secretion, transfer, and uptake of extracellular miRNAs.},

abstract = {Background: Although it has long been appreciated that ovarian carcinoma subtypes (serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous) are associated with different natural histories, most ovarian carcinoma biomarker studies and current treatment protocols for women with this disease are not subtype specific. With the emergence of high-throughput molecular techniques, distinct pathogenetic pathways have been identified in these subtypes. We examined variation in biomarker expression rates between subtypes, and how this influences correlations between biomarker expression and stage at diagnosis or prognosis. Methods and Findings: In this retrospective study we assessed the protein expression of 21 candidate tissue-based biomarkers (CA125, CRABP-II, EpCam, ER, F-Spondin, HE4, IGF2, K-Cadherin, Ki-67, KISS1, Matriptase, Mesothelin, MIF, MMP7, p21, p53, PAX8, PR, SLP1 TROP2, WT1) in a population-based cohort of 500 ovarian carcinomas that was collected over the period from 1984 to 2000. The expression of 20 of the 21 biomarkers differs significantly between subtypes, but does not vary across stage within each subtype. Survival analyses show that nine of the 21 biomarkers are prognostic indicators in the entire cohort but when analyzed by subtype only three remain prognostic indicators in the high-grade serous and none in the clear cell subtype. For example, tumor proliferation, as assessed by Ki-67 staining, varies markedly between different subtypes and is an unfavourable prognostic marker in the entire cohort (risk ratio [RR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.2%-2.4%) but is not of prognostic significance within any subtype. Prognostic associations can even show an inverse correlation within the entire cohort, when compared to a specific subtype. For example, WT1 is more frequently expressed in high-grade serous carcinomas, an aggressive subtype, and is an unfavourable prognostic marker within the entire cohort of ovarian carcinomas (RR 1.7, 95% Cl 1.2%-2.3%), but is a favourable prognostic marker within the high-grade serous subtype (RR 0.5, 95% Cl 0.3%-0.8%). Conclusions: The association of biomarker expression with survival varies substantially between subtypes, and can easily be overlooked in whole cohort analyses. To avoid this effect, each subtype within a cohort should be analyzed discretely. Ovarian carcinoma subtypes are different diseases, and these differences should be reflected in clinical research study design and ultimately in the management of ovarian carcinoma.

abstract = {Aim: Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynecologic cancers that has the highest mortality rate. Considering the fact that knowledge on the incidence, mortality of ovarian cancer, as well as its risk factors is necessary for planning and preventing complications, this study was conducted with the aim of examining the epidemiology and risk factors of ovarian cancer in the world. Materials and methods: In order to access the articles, Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus databases were searched from their start to the year 2018. Full-text, English observational studies that referred to various aspects of ovarian cancer were included in the study. Results: In total, 125 articles that had been published during the years 1925–2018 were entered into the study. Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer among women. Increased risk factors of cancer have led to an upward trend in the incidence of cancer around the world. In 2018, 4.4% of entire cancer-related mortality among women was attributed to ovarian cancer. Although the incidence of cancer is higher among high Human Development Index (HDI) countries, the trend of mortality rate tends to be reversing. Various factors affect the occurrence of ovarian cancer, from which genetic factor are among the most important ones. Pregnancy, lactation, and oral contraceptive pills play a role in reducing the risk of this disease. Conclusion: This study provides significant evidence about ovarian cancer. Considering the heavy burden of ovarian cancer on women's health, preventive measures as well as health education and early detection in high risk groups of women are highly recommended. Although some risk factors cannot be changed, a focus on preventable risk factors may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. More studies are needed to explore the role of unclear risk factors in ovarian cancer occurrence.},

Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

abstract = {Proteins of the annexin family bind to phospholipids in a Ca2+ dependent manner. The exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) by apoptotic as well as necrotic cells is one major eat-me-signal for macrophages. Annexin A5 (Anx A5) preferentially binds to PS. The availability of Anx A5 knock out (KO) mice allowed us to investigate for the first time if endogenous Anx A5 modulates the immune response towards allogeneic cells. Furthermore, the effect of Anx A5 gene deletion on the phagocytic process as well as on the inflammatory reaction of macrophages was explored. We found that Anx A5 KO mice have a strongly reduced allogeneic cellular immune reaction against primary as well as secondary necrotic cells. In vivo phagocytosis experiments revealed that macrophages of Anx A5 KO mice displayed an increased uptake of necrotic cells. Additionally, an increased secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 of isolated macrophages of Anx A5 KO mice after contact with necrotic cells was observed. Furthermore, the promoter activity of the Anx A5 gene was enhanced after stimulation of macrophages. The tumour size of an allogeneic tumour regressed faster when endogenous Anx A5 was present. These data demonstrate that endogenous Anx A5 influences the phagocytosis of necrotic cells, modulates the immune response towards allogeneic cells and acts as an inflammatory protein. {\textcopyright} 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynaecologic malignancy. Despite progresses in chemotherapy and ultra-radical surgeries, this locally metastatic disease presents a high rate of local recurrence advocating for the role of a peritoneal niche. For several years, it was believed that tumor initiation, progression and metastasis were merely due to the changes in the neoplastic cell population and the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues were regarded as bystanders. The importance of the tumor microenvironment and its cellular component emerged from studies on the histopathological sequence of changes at the interface between putative tumor cells and the surrounding non-neoplastic tissues during carcinogenesis.Method: In this review we aimed to describe the pro-tumoral crosstalk between ovarian cancer and mesenchymal stem cells. A PubMed search was performed for articles published pertaining to mesenchymal stem cells and specific to ovarian cancer.Results: Mesenchymal stem cells participate to an elaborate crosstalk through direct and paracrine interaction with ovarian cancer cells. They play a role at different stages of the disease: survival and peritoneal infiltration at early stage, proliferation in distant sites, chemoresistance and recurrence at later stage.Conclusion: The dialogue between ovarian and mesenchymal stem cells induces the constitution of a pro-tumoral mesencrine niche. Understanding the dynamics of such interaction in a clinical setting might propose new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Translation rule selection is a task of selecting appropriate translation rules for an ambiguous source-language segment. As translation ambiguities are pervasive in statistical machine translation, we introduce two topic-based models for translation rule selection which incorporates global topic information into translation disambiguation. We associate each synchronous translation rule with source- and target-side topic distributions.With these topic distributions, we propose a topic dissimilarity model to select desirable (less dissimilar) rules by imposing penalties for rules with a large value of dissimilarity of their topic distributions to those of given documents. In order to encourage the use of non-topic specific translation rules, we also present a topic sensitivity model to balance translation rule selection between generic rules and topic-specific rules. Furthermore, we project target-side topic distributions onto the source-side topic model space so that we can benefit from topic information of both the source and target language. We integrate the proposed topic dissimilarity and sensitivity model into hierarchical phrase-based machine translation for synchronous translation rule selection. Experiments show that our topic-based translation rule selection model can substantially improve translation quality.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs are natural, single-stranded, small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to target mRNAs and suppress its translation or initiate its degradation. In contrast to the identification and validation of many miRNA genes is the lack of experimental evidence identifying their corresponding mRNA targets. The most fundamental challenge in miRNA biology is to define the rules of miRNA target recognition. This is critical since the biological role of individual miRNAs will be dictated by the mRNAs that they regulate. Therefore, only as target mRNAs are validated will it be possible to establish commonalities that will enable more precise predictions of miRNA/mRNA interactions. Currently there is no clear agreement as to what experimental procedures should be followed to demonstrate that a given mRNA is a target of a specific miRNA. Therefore, this review outlines several methods by which to validate miRNA targets. Additionally, we propose that multiple criteria should be met before miRNA target validation should be considered "confirmed.". {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Ovarian serous carcinomas have been graded using various systems. Recently, a 2-tier system in which tumors are subdivided into low grade and high grade has been proposed. This approach is simplistic, reproducible, and based on biologic evidence indicating that both tumors develop via different pathways. Low-grade serous carcinomas exhibit low-grade nuclei with infrequent mitotic figures. They evolve from adenofibromas or borderline tumors, have frequent mutations of the KRAS, BRAF, or ERBB2 genes, and lack TP53 mutations (Type I pathway). The progression to invasive carcinoma is a slow step-wise process. Low-grade tumors are indolent and have better outcome than high-grade tumors. In contrast, high-grade serous carcinomas have high-grade nuclei and numerous mitotic figures. Identification of a precursor lesion in the ovary has been elusive and therefore the origin of ovarian carcinoma has been described as de novo. More recently, studies have suggested that a proportion seem to originate from intraepithelial carcinoma in the fallopian tube. The development of these tumors is rapid (Type II pathway). Most are characterized by TP53 mutations and lack mutations of KRAS, BRAF, or ERBB2. Although both types of serous carcinomas evolve along different pathways, rare high-grade serous carcinomas seem to arise through the Type I pathway. Immunohistochemical stains for p53, p16, and Ki-67 for distinction of low-grade from high-grade tumors are of limited value but can be helpful in selected instances. This review provides an update on the pathogenesis and clinicopathologic features of these 2 types of serous carcinomas and addresses some of the diagnostic problems that are encountered in routine practice. {\textcopyright} 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as master switch regulators in many biological processes in health and disease, including neuropathy. miRNAs are commonly quantified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), usually estimated as relative expression through reference genes normalization. Different non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are used for miRNA normalization; however, there is no study identifying the optimal reference genes in animal models for peripheral nerve injury. We evaluated the stability of eleven ncRNAs, commonly used for miRNA normalization, in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), dorsal horn of the spinal cord (dhSC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the mouse spared nerve injury (SNI) model. After RT-qPCR, the stability of each ncRNA was determined by using four different methods: BestKeeper, the comparative delta-Cq method, geNorm, and NormFinder. The candidates were rated according to their performance in each method and an overall ranking list was compiled. The most stable ncRNAs were: sno420, sno429, and sno202 in DRG; sno429, sno202, and U6 in dhSC; sno202, sno420, and sno142 in mPFC. We provide the first reference genes' evaluation for miRNA normalization in different neuronal tissues in an animal model of peripheral nerve injury. Our results underline the need for careful selection of reference genes for miRNA normalization in different tissues and experimental conditions. We further anticipate that our findings can be used in a broad range of nerve injury related studies, to ensure validity and promote reproducibility in miRNA quantification.},

By pairing to microRNA responsive elements (mREs) on target mRNAs, miRNAs play gene-regulatory roles, producing remarkable changes in several physiological and pathological processes. Thus, the identification of miRNA-mRNA target interactions is fundamental for discovering the regulatory network governed by miRNAs. The best way to achieve this goal is usually by computational prediction followed by experimental validation of these miRNA-mRNA interactions. This review summarizes the key strategies for miRNA target identification. Several tools for computational analysis exist, each with different approaches to predict miRNA targets, and their number is constantly increasing. The major algorithms available for this aim, including Machine Learning methods, are discussed, to provide practical tips for familiarizing with their assumptions and understanding how to interpret the results. Then, all the experimental procedures for verifying the authenticity of the identified miRNA-mRNA target pairs are described, including High-Throughput technologies, in order to find the best approach for miRNA validation. For each strategy, strengths and weaknesses are discussed, to enable users to evaluate and select the right approach for their interests.},

abstract = {Ovarian carcinomas comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, the four most common subtypes being serous, endometrioid, clear cell and mucinous. In recent years, our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis and initiating molecular events in the different tumour subtypes has greatly increased, and although ovarian carcinoma is often considered clinically as one disease, there is now a much greater realisation that the various subtypes have a different natural behaviour and prognosis. At present, adjuvant therapy is mainly dependent upon tumour stage and grade rather than type; however, this is likely to change in the future with the development of new chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapies and clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of different agents in clear cell, mucinous and low grade serous carcinomas, neoplasms which are considered relatively resistant to traditional chemotherapeutic regimes. In this review, the major subtypes of ovarian carcinoma are discussed. It is now firmly established that there are two distinct types of ovarian serous carcinoma, low grade and high grade, the former being much less common and arising in many cases from a serous borderline tumour. Low grade and high grade serous carcinoma represent two distinct tumour types with a different underlying pathogenesis rather than low grade and high grade variants of the same neoplasm. Both are usually advanced stage (stage III or IV) at diagnosis. B-raf and k-ras mutations are important molecular events in low grade serous carcinomas while high grade serous carcinomas are almost always associated with TP53 mutation. There is now emerging and compelling evidence that many high grade serous carcinomas (by far the most common subtype of ovarian carcinoma) actually arise from the epithelium of the distal fallopian tube. Future studies regarding the initiating molecular events in the development of this aggressive neoplasm should concentrate on this site. Primary ovarian mucinous carcinomas are uncommon, almost always unilateral and stage I, and largely of so-called intestinal or enteric type. Most arise in a stepwise manner from a pre-existing mucinous cystadenoma and mucinous borderline tumour. Endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas typically present as low stage neoplasms and in many, or most, cases arise from endometriosis; the former are usually well differentiated and there is now evidence that the majority of neoplasms reported in the past as high grade endometrioid carcinoma are of serous type. WT1 is useful in this regard since it is a relatively specific marker of a serous phenotype. It is recommended that different subtypes of ovarian carcinoma are graded using different systems rather than employing a universal grading system.},

abstract = {Background Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death by gynecologic cancers in the Western world. The aim of the study was to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with prognosis and/or resistance to chemotherapy among patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods Using information from the Pelvic Mass Study we identified a cohort of women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Tumor tissues were then collected and analyzed by global miRNA microarrays. MiRNA profiling was then linked to survival and time to progression using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Logistic regression models were used for the analysis of resistance to chemotherapy. Our results were validated using external datasets retrieved from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. Results A total of 197 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer were included for miRNA microarray analysis. In multivariate analyses we identified a number of miRNAs significantly correlated with overall survival (miR-1183 (HR: 1.42, 95% CI:1.17–1.74, p = 0.0005), miR-126-3p (HR: 1.38, 95% CI:1.11–1.71, p = 0.0036), time to progression (miR-139-3p (HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.13–1.94, p = 0.0047), miR-802 (HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29–0.78, p = 0.0035)), progression free survival (miR-23a-5p (HR:1.32, 95% CI:1.09–1.61, p = 0.004), miR-23a-3p (HR:1.70, 95% CI:1.15–2.51, p = 0.0074), miR-802 (HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29–0.80, p = 0.0048)), and resistance to chemotherapy (miR-1234 (HR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.11–0.64, p = 0.003)). A few miRNAs identified in our training cohort, were validated in external cohorts with similar results. Conclusion Eight miRNAs were identified as significant predictors of overall survival, progression free survival, time to progression, and chemotherapy resistance. A number of these miRNAs were significantly validated using external datasets. Inter-platform and inter-laboratory variations may have influence on the ability to compare and reproduce miRNA results. The use of miRNAs as potential markers of relapse and survival in ovarian cancer warrants further investigation.},

Recent advances in miRNA research have provided evidence that aberrant expression of specific miRNAs is associated with a broad spectrum of human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, psychological disorders and others. Global microRNAome profiling has demonstrated drastic changes in expression of multiple miRNAs in many common human cancers. miRNA expression signatures have been shown to provide a more accurate method of classifying cancer subtypes than transcriptome profiling of an entire set of known protein-coding genes. miRNA profiling also allows classification of different stages in tumor progression and can predict disease outcome in some cases. Further characterization of these abnormal miRNA expression signatures and identification of the most significant and informative aberrantly expressed miRNAs could lead to the development of tissue- and biofluid-specific diagnostic markers, as well as a new type of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. As researchers continue to study miRNA expression in cancer and focus on most relevant miRNAs, the further advancement of miRNA-detection technologies and bioinformatics algorithms is critical for successful identification of the most informative diagnostics markers among the tissue-specific miRNAs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Future Drugs Ltd.},

abstract = {The significance and extent of Ca(2+) regulation of the biosynthetic secretory pathway have been difficult to establish, and our knowledge of regulatory relationships integrating Ca(2+) with vesicle coats and function is rudimentary. Here, we investigated potential roles and mechanisms of luminal Ca(2+) in the early secretory pathway. Specific depletion of luminal Ca(2+) in living normal rat kidney cells using cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) resulted in the extreme expansion of vesicular tubular cluster (VTC) elements. Consistent with this, a suppressive role for vesicle-associated Ca(2+) in COPII vesicle homotypic fusion was demonstrated in vitro using Ca(2+) chelators. The EF-hand-containing protein apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2), previously implicated in the stabilization of sec31 at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, inhibited COPII vesicle fusion in a Ca(2+)-requiring manner, suggesting that ALG-2 may be a sensor for the effects of vesicular Ca(2+) on homotypic fusion. Immunoisolation established that Ca(2+) chelation inhibits and ALG-2 specifically favors residual retention of the COPII outer shell protein sec31 on pre-Golgi fusion intermediates. We conclude that vesicle-associated Ca(2+), acting through ALG-2, favors the retention of residual coat molecules that seem to suppress membrane fusion. We propose that in cells, these Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms temporally regulate COPII vesicle interactions, VTC biogenesis, cargo sorting, and VTC maturation.},

The problem is exac- erbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments. CONTENT: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote con- sistency between laboratories, and increase experimen- tal transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that de- scribe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can as- sess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is neces- sary to enable other investigators to reproduce results.

abstract = {Background: Control genes, which are often referred to as housekeeping genes, are frequently used to normalise mRNA levels between different samples. However, the expression level of these genes may vary among tissues or cells and may change under certain circumstances. Thus, the selection of housekeeping genes is critical for gene expression studies. To address this issue, 7 candidate housekeeping genes including several commonly used ones were investigated in isolated human reticulocytes. For this, a simple $\Delta$Ct approach was employed by comparing relative expression of 'pairs of genes' within each sample. On this basis, stability of the candidate housekeeping genes was ranked according to repeatability of the gene expression differences among 31 samples. Results: Initial screening of the expression pattern demonstrated that 1 of the 7 genes was expressed at very low levels in reticulocytes and was excluded from further analysis. The range of expression stability of the other 6 genes was (from most stable to least stable): GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), SDHA (succinate dehydrogenase), HPRT1 (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1), HBS1L (HBS1-like protein) and AHSP (alpha haemoglobin stabilising protein), followed by B2M (beta-2-microglobulin). Conclusion: Using this simple approach, GAPDH was found to be the most suitable housekeeping gene for expression studies in reticulocytes while the commonly used B2M should be avoided. {\textcopyright} 2006 Silver et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate normalization is an absolute prerequisite for correct measurement of gene expression. For quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), the most commonly used normalization strategy involves standardization to a single constitutively expressed control gene. However, in recent years, it has become clear that no single gene is constitutively expressed in all cell types and under all experimental conditions, implying that the expression stability of the intended control gene has to be verified before each experiment. We outline a novel, innovative, and robust strategy to identify stably expressed genes among a set of candidate normalization genes. The strategy is rooted in a mathematical model of gene expression that enables estimation not only of the overall variation of the candidate normalization genes but also of the variation between sample subgroups of the sample set. Notably, the strategy provides a direct measure for the estimated expression variation, enabling the user to evaluate the systematic error introduced when using the gene. In a side-by-side comparison with a previously published strategy, our model-based approach performed in a more robust manner and showed less sensitivity toward coregulation of the candidate normalization genes. We used the model-based strategy to identify genes suited to normalize quantitative RT-PCR data from colon cancer and bladder cancer. These genes are UBC, GAPD, and TPT1 for the colon and HSPCB, TEGT, and ATP5B for the bladder. The presented strategy can be applied to evaluate the suitability of any normalization gene candidate in any kind of experimental design and should allow more reliable normalization of RT-PCR data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene-expression analysis is increasingly important in biological research, with real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) becoming the method of choice for high-throughput and accurate expression profiling of selected genes. Given the increased sensitivity, reproducibility and large dynamic range of this methodology, the requirements for a proper internal control gene for normalization have become increasingly stringent. Although housekeeping gene expression has been reported to vary considerably, no systematic survey has properly determined the errors related to the common practice of using only one control gene, nor presented an adequate way of working around this problem. RESULTS: We outline a robust and innovative strategy to identify the most stably expressed control genes in a given set of tissues, and to determine the minimum number of genes required to calculate a reliable normalization factor. We have evaluated ten housekeeping genes from different abundance and functional classes in various human tissues, and demonstrated that the conventional use of a single gene for normalization leads to relatively large errors in a significant proportion of samples tested. The geometric mean of multiple carefully selected housekeeping genes was validated as an accurate normalization factor by analyzing publicly available microarray data. CONCLUSIONS: The normalization strategy presented here is a prerequisite for accurate RT-PCR expression profiling, which, among other things, opens up the possibility of studying the biological relevance of small expression differences.},

abstract = {Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns have been associated with a number of human diseases. Accurate quantitation of miRNA levels is important for their use as biomarkers and in determining their functions. Although the issue of proper miRNA detection was solved with the introduction of standard reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays, numerous issues with the selection of appropriate internal control genes remain. U6 (RNU6-1) snRNA, the most commonly used internal control gene in miRNA RT-qPCR assays, was shown to be unstable in clinical samples, particularly cancer tissues. Identification of the distribution of U6 in different tissues is the premise of more accurate quantification of miRNAs. However, the distribution of U6 in human carcinoma tissues and corresponding normal tissues is unknown. In the present study, U6 levels were significantly higher in human breast carcinoma tissues compared with the corresponding normal tissues by RT-qPCR. In the carcinoma or corresponding adjacent normal tissues, the expression levels of U6 in epithelial cells were higher than those in the mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of U6 in the carcinoma tissues of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts were higher than those in the adjacent normal tissues. These results suggest that the expression and distribution of U6 exhibits a high degree of variability among several types of human cells. Therefore, caution is required when selecting U6 as an internal control gene for evaluating expression profiles of miRNAs in patients with carcinoma, particularly carcinoma of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts.},

abstract = {Recently, microRNAs have been detected in serum and plasma, and circulating microRNA (miRNA) profiles have now been associated with many diseases such as cancers and heart disease, as well as altered physiological states. Because of their stability and disease resistance, circulation miRNAs appear to be an ideal material for biomarkers of diseases and physiological states in blood. However, the lack of a suitable internal reference gene (internal reference miRNA) has hampered research and application of circulating miRNAs. Currently, U6 and miR-16 are the most common endogenous controls in the research of miRNAs in tissues and cells. We performed microarray-based serum miRNA profiling on the serum of 20 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and 20 controls to detect the expressions of U6 and miRNAs. Profiling was followed by real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) in 80 patients (20 each with gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer) and 30 non-cancerous controls. qPCR was also performed to detect miRNAs in serum with repeated freezing and thawing. The results of microarray showed that with the exception of U6, Ct values of miR-16, miR-24, miR-142-3p, miR-19b and miR-192 in serum samples of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were greater than control samples. The results of 110 cases showed large fluctuations in U6 expression. The difference between the greatest and the least levels of expression was 3.29 for delta Ct values, and 1.23 for miR-16. The expressions of U6, miR-16 and miR-24 in serum subjected to different freeze-thaw cycles showed that U6 expression gradually decreased after 1, 2, and 4 cycles of freezing and thawing, while the expression of miR-16 and miR-24 remained relatively stable. Collectively, our results suggested that U6 is unsuitable as an internal reference gene in the research of circulating miRNAs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression and have been associated with the development of various cancers, including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Accurate quantification of miRNA levels is important for determining their role in tumorigenesis and as biomarkers. Currently, U6 is widely used as a normalization control when investigating miRNAs in EOC; however, its variable expression across cancers has been reported. As only a few studies have been published to date on the identification of endogenous miRNA controls in EOC, our aim was to identify stable miRNAs based on global microarray profiling of 197 EOC patients and verify their stability in external datasets. MATERIALS AND METHODS We collected miRNA-microarray data from four datasets: the in-house "Pelvic Mass", and three public datasets with primary EOC patients: The Cancer Genome Atlas, GSE47841, and GSE73581. The expression stability of endogenous control candidates was evaluated by their coefficient of variation. RESULTS All miRNA results in the used cohorts were produced by either Affymetrix or Agilent technologies, which show similar intra-platform patterns. Nonetheless, a clear difference in a cross-platform comparison was observed. We identified hsa-miR-92b-5p and hsa-miR-106b-3p as stable candidates shared between four datasets. Moreover, we investigated the stability performance of eight miRNAs that have been previously reported as stable endogenous controls in EOC and various performance was observed in four datasets. CONCLUSION The selection of suitable endogenous miRNA normalization controls in EOC remains to be resolved, as variability in miRNA performance between platforms might have a crucial impact on the biological interpretation of data.},

Multiple investigations reported miRNAs aberrantly expressed in several cancers, including high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGS-OvCa). Quantitative PCR is widely used in studies investigating miRNA expression and the identification of reliable endogenous controls is crucial for proper data normalization. In this study, we aimed to experimentally identify the most stable reference sncRNAs for normalization of miRNA qPCR expression data in HGS-OvCa. Eleven putative reference sncRNAs for normalization (U6, SNORD48, miR-92a-3p, let-7a-5p, SNORD61, SNORD72, SNORD68, miR-103a-3p, miR-423-3p, miR-191-5p, miR-16-5p) were analysed on a total of 75 HGS-OvCa and 30 normal tissues, using a highly specific qPCR. Both the normal tissues considered to initiate HGS-OvCa malignant transformation, namely ovary and fallopian tube epithelia, were included in our study. Stability of candidate endogenous controls was evaluated using an equivalence test and validated by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. Combining results from the three different statistical approaches, SNORD48 emerged as stably and equivalently expressed between malignant and normal tissues. Among malignant samples, considering groups based on residual tumour, miR-191-5p was identified as the most equivalent sncRNA. On the basis of our results, we support the use of SNORD48 as best reference sncRNA for relative quantification in miRNA expression studies between HGS-OvCa and normal controls, including the first time both the normal tissues supposed to be HGS-OvCa progenitors. In addition, we recommend miR-191-5p as best reference sncRNA in miRNA expression studies with prognostic intent on HGS-OvCa tissues.},

Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is one of the most powerful techniques for analyzing miRs; however, the use of unsuitable normalizers might bias the results. Tumour heterogeneity makes even more difficult the selection of an adequate endogenous normalizer control. Here, we have evaluated five potential referenced small RNAs (U6, rRNA5s, SNORD44, SNORD24 and hsa-miR-24c-3p) using RedFinder algorisms to perform a stability expression analysis in i) normal colon cells, ii) colon and breast cancer cell lines and iii) cancer stem-like cell subpopulations. We identified SNORD44 as a suitable housekeeping gene for qPCR analysis comparing normal and cancer cells. However, this small nucleolar RNA was not a useful normalizer for cancer stem-like cell subpopulations versus subpopulations without stemness properties. In addition, we show for the first time that hsa-miR-24c-3p is the most stable normalizer for comparing these two subpopulations. Also, we have identified by bioinformatic and qPCR analysis, different miR expression patterns in colon cancer versus non tumour cells using the previously selected suitable normalizers. Our results emphasize the importance of select suitable normalizers to ensure the robustness and reliability of qPCR data for analyzing miR expression.},

The functions available in miRDeepFinder include pre-processing of raw data, identifying conserved miRNAs, mining and classifying novel miRNAs, miRNA expression profiling, predicting miRNA targets, and gene pathway and gene network analysis involving miRNAs. The fundamental design of miRDeepFinder is based on miRNA biogenesis, miRNA-mediated gene regulation and target recognition, such as perfect or near perfect hairpin structures, different read abundances of miRNA and miRNA*, and targeting patterns of plant miRNAs. To test the accuracy and robustness of miRDeepFinder, we analyzed a small RNA deep sequencing dataset of Arabidopsis thaliana published in the GEO database of NCBI. Our test retrieved 128 of 131 (97. 7%) known miRNAs that have a more than 3 read count in Arabidopsis. Because many known miRNAs are not associated with miRNA*s in small RNA datasets, miRDeepFinder was also designed to recover miRNA candidates without the presence of miRNA*. To mine as many miRNAs as possible, miRDeepFinder allows users to compare mature miRNAs and their miRNA*s with other small RNA datasets from the same species. Cleaveland software package was also incorporated into miRDeepFinder for miRNA target identification using degradome sequencing analysis. Using this new computational tool, we identified 13 novel miRNA candidates with miRNA*s from Arabidopsis and validated 12 of them experimentally. Interestingly, of the 12 verified novel miRNAs, a miRNA named AC1 spans the exons of two genes (UTG71C4 and UGT71C3). Both the mature AC1 miRNA and its miRNA* were also found in four other small RNA datasets. We also developed a tool, "miRNA primer designer" to design primers for any type of miRNAs. miRDeepFinder provides a powerful tool for analyzing small RNA datasets from all species, with or without the availability of genome information. miRDeepFinder and miRNA primer designer are freely available at http://www.leonxie.com/DeepFinder.php and at http://www.leonxie.com/miRNAprimerDesigner.php, respectively.

The current diagnostic and prognostic routine available for OC management either lack specificity or are very costly. Gene expression profiling has shown to be a very effective tool in exploring new molecular markers for patients with OC, although association of such markers with patient survival and clinical outcome is still elusive. Here, we performed gene expression profiling of different subtypes of OC to evaluate its association with patient overall survival (OS) and aggressive forms of the disease. By global mRNA microarray profiling in a total of 196 epithelial OC patients (161 serous, 15 endometrioid, 11 mucinous, and 9 clear cell carcinomas), we found four candidates-HSPA1A, CD99, RAB3A and POM121L9P, which associated with OS and poor clinicopathological features. The overexpression of all combined was correlated with shorter OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Furthermore, the combination of at least two markers were further associated with advanced grade, chemotherapy resistance, and progressive disease. These results indicate that a panel comprised of a few predictors that associates with a more aggressive form of OC may be clinically relevant, presenting a better performance than one marker alone.},

abstract = {Malignant epithelial tumors (carcinomas) are the most common ovarian cancers and also the most lethal gynecological malignancies. Based on histopathology and molecular genetic alterations, ovarian carcinomas are divided into five main types (high-grade serous (70%), endometrioid (10%), clear cell (10%), mucinous (3%), and lowgrade serous carcinomas (<5%) that account for over 95% of cases. These types are essentially distinct diseases, as indicated by differences in epidemiological and genetic risk factors, precursor lesions, patterns of spread, and molecular events during oncogenesis, response to chemotherapy, and prognosis. For a successful specific treatment, reproducible histopathological diagnosis of the tumor cell type is critical. The five tumor types are morphologically diverse and resemble carcinomas of the uterus. Actually, recent investigations have demonstrated that a significant number of cancers, traditionally thought to be primary ovarian tumors (particularly serous, endometrioid, and clear cell carcinomas), originate in the fallopian tube and the endometrium and involve the ovary secondarily. This review summarizes recent advances in the molecular pathology which have greatly improved our understanding of the biology of ovarian carcinoma and are also relevant to patient management. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Today, numerous high-throughput laboratory methods allow rapid and holistic screening for such marker candidates. Regardless of which molecular level is analysed, in order to detect biomarker candidates, high sample quality and a standardised and highly reproducible quantification workflow are prerequisites. This article describes an optimal and approved development strategy to discover and validate 'transcriptional biomarkers' in clinical diagnostics, which are in compliance with the recently developed MIQE guidelines3. We focus on the importance of sample quality, RNA integrity, available screening and quantification methods, and biostatistical tools for data interpretation.},

These polynomials can be obtained from the little q-Jacobi polynomials in the limit q = -1. We also show that these polynomials provide a nontrivial realization of the Askey-Wilson algebra for q = -1. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Thellin1999,
abstract = {Quantitative studies are commonly realised in the biomedical research to compare RNA expression in different experimental or clinical conditions. These quantifications are performed through their comparison to the expression of the housekeeping gene transcripts like glyceraldehyde-3- phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), albumin, actins, tubulins, cyclophilin, hypoxantine phosphoribosyltransferase (HRPT), L32. 28S and 18S rRNAs are also used as internal standards. In this paper, it is recalled that the commonly used internal standards can quantitatively vary in response to various factors. Possible variations are illustrated using three experimental examples. Preferred types of internal standards are then proposed for each of these samples and thereafter the general procedure concerning the choice of an internal standard and the way to manage its used are discussed.},

@article{Blondal2013a,
abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small cellular RNAs (typically 21-23. nt) that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Current estimates indicate that more than one third of the cellular transcriptome is regulated by miRNAs, although they are relatively few in number (less than 2000 human miRNAs).The high relative stability of miRNA in common clinical tissues and biofluids (e.g. plasma, serum, urine, saliva, etc.) and the ability of miRNA expression profiles to accurately classify discrete tissue types and disease states have positioned miRNA quantification as a promising new tool for a wide range of diagnostic applications. Furthermore miRNAs have been shown to be rapidly released from tissues into the circulation with the development of pathology. To facilitate discovery and clinical development of miRNA-based biomarkers, we developed a genome-wide Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA™)-based miRNA qPCR platform with unparalleled sensitivity and robustness. The platform allows high-throughput profiling of miRNAs from important clinical sources without the need for pre-amplification. Using this system, we have profiled thousands of biofluid samples including blood derived plasma and serum. An extensive quality control (QC) system has been implemented in order to secure technical excellence and reveal any unwanted bias coming from pre-analytical or analytical variables. We present our approaches to sample and RNA QC as well as data QC and normalization. Specifically we have developed normal reference ranges for circulating miRNAs in serum and plasma as well as a hemolysis indicator based on microRNA expression. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},
