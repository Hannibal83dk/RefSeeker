Great job!!!

	Some comments:
	1.	Maybe a name of the package should be re-considered, as it is really close to RefFinder. Sometimes it might create problems.
	2.	Regarding a batch of experiments. Preparing an excel file with multiple sheets can be a time-consuming task, it will be much easier for a potential user to provide a list of files, by for example:
		filelist = list.files(pattern = "name.txt") and running next command that it will process all the files. The outcome of most of the software can be saved as a txt file and it will be a huge plus, if the user could avoid creating excel file.
	3.	What about showing the options of creating nice, ready-to-publish tables?
	
	library(kableExtra)
	library(flextable)
	
	rf_results$rankTable %>%    kbl() %>% kable_styling()
	rf_results$rankTable %>% flextable() %>% theme_vanilla() %>% autofit() %>% save_as_docx(path="H:/miRNAvalidation/Reffinder_projects/rankTable.docx") 
	
	4.	Minor things: 
		a.	the names of algorithms are written in a different way:
			i.	In a vignette: It uses the RefFinder method which includes a stabilities calculated by four different algorithms: Normfinder, geNorm, bestKeeper and delta-Ct. 
			ii.	When it creates tables: Delta Ct Bestkeeper Normfinder Genorm Comprehensive Rank
				So it needs to be unified. Moreover, there should not be spaces for example: not Delta Ct, but Delta-Ct (or whatever name you decide for)
		XX b.	You wrote “And viola! Now you can select the targets with the lowest stability value as refference genes for your expression studies”. Did you mean French voilà/voila:https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/voil%C3%A0 
		XX c.	There are some spelling errors, for example: No parameters is required, should be are required. If you send a description as a file, I can add more comments.

Multigraph:
Warning message:
Unknown or uninitialised column: `stabilityTable`. -> rf_reffinder() has not been used to calculate stabilities. raw data input.


Implement option to do batch as single data graph or as multigraph.
	- maybe also option for outputting to a single excelfile/csv



rf_graph need some check to see if a graph was initiated. if any of the ifs were activated



rf_loadcsvdata:
	- Some control over file extensions and which files are loaded from a given folder.
		- all files in a folder is loaded and processed similarly
	- Maybe a dialog to select files, or folders.

rf_graph:
	- Add a lineshift between messages from the graphwrapper and the graph output message
		> rf_graph(refResults, "TestOutput/refGraph", outputPng = TRUE)
		I see multible data sets we should run the multigraphA png file was created: TestOutput/refGraph_2022-07-07.png




csv batch:
	- Add graph to batch output
